<p class="noindent"><span class="fs150">T</span>his Journal is intended to embrace the circle
of <span class="smcap">the Physical Sciences</span>, with their application
to <span class="smcap">the Arts</span>, and to every useful purpose.</p>

<p>It is designed as a deposit for <em>original American
communications</em>; it will contain also occasional
selections from Foreign Journals, and notices of
the progress of Science in other countries. Within
its plan are embraced</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Natural History</span>, in its three great departments
of <span class="smcap">Mineralogy</span>, <span class="smcap">Botany</span>, and <span class="smcap">Zoology</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chemistry</span> and <span class="smcap">Natural Philosophy</span>, and their
various branches: and <span class="smcap">Mathematics</span>, pure and
mixed.</p>

<p>It will be a leading object to illustrate <span class="smcap">American
Natural History</span>, and especially our <span class="smcap">Mineralogy</span>
and <span class="smcap">Geology</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Applications</span> of these sciences are obviously
as numerous as <em>physical arts</em>, and <em>physical
wants</em>; for no one of these arts or wants can be
named which is not connected with them.</p>

<p>While <span class="smcap">Science</span> will be cherished <em>for its own
sake</em>, and with a due respect for its own <em>inherent</em>
dignity; it will also be employed as the <em>hand-maid
to the Arts</em>. Its numerous applications to
<span class="smcap">Agriculture</span>, the earliest and most important
of them: to <span class="smcap">Manufactures</span>, both mechanical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
chemical; and, to <span class="smcap">Domestic Economy</span>, will be
carefully sought out, and faithfully made.</p>

<p>It is within the design of this Journal to receive
communications likewise on <span class="smcap">Music</span>, <span class="smcap">Sculpture</span>,
<span class="smcap">Engraving</span>, <span class="smcap">Painting</span>, and generally on the fine
and liberal, as well as useful arts;</p>

<p>On Military and Civil Engineering, and the
art of Navigation;</p>

<p>Notices, Reviews, and Analyses of new scientific
works; accounts of Inventions, and Specifications
of Patents;</p>

<p>Biographical and Obituary Notices of scientific
men; essays on <span class="smcap">Comparative Anatomy</span> and <span class="smcap">Physiology</span>,
and generally on such other branches of
medicine as depend on scientific principles;</p>

<p>Meteorological Registers, and Reports of Agricultural
Experiments: and interesting Miscellaneous
Articles, not perhaps exactly included under
either of the above heads.</p>

<p>Communications are respectfully solicited from
men of science, and <em>from men versed in the practical
arts</em>.</p>

<p>Learned Societies are invited to make this
Journal, occasionally, the vehicle of their communications
to the Public.</p>

<p>The Editor will not hold himself responsible
for the sentiments and opinions advanced by his
correspondents: he will consider it as an allowed
liberty to make slight <em>verbal alterations</em>, where
errors may be presumed to have arisen from inadvertency.</p>

<h2><em>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</em></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he age in which we live is not less distinguished by a
vigorous and successful cultivation of physical science, than by
its numerous and important applications to the practical arts,
and to the common purposes of life.</p>

<p>In every enlightened country, men illustrious for talent,
worth, and knowledge, are ardently engaged in enlarging the
boundaries of natural science; and the history of their labours
and discoveries is communicated to the world chiefly through
the medium of Scientific Journals. The utility of such Journals
has thus become generally evident; they are the heralds of
science; they proclaim its toils and its achievements; they
demonstrate its intimate connexion as well with the comfort,
as with the intellectual and moral improvement of our species;
and they often procure for it enviable honours and substantial
rewards.</p>

<p>In England the interests of science have been, for a series
of years, greatly promoted by the excellent Journals of Tilloch
and Nicholson; and for the loss of the latter, the scientific
world has been fully compensated by Dr. Thomson's Annals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Philosophy, and by the Journal of Science and the Arts, both
published in London.</p>

<p>In France, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie et de Physique</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal
des Mines</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Physique</span>, &amp;c. have long enjoyed
a high and deserved reputation. Indeed, there are few countries
in Europe which do not produce some similar publication;
not to mention the transactions of learned societies and
numerous medical Journals.</p>

<p>From these sources <em>our</em> country reaps, and will long continue
to reap, an abundant harvest of information: and if the
light of science, as well as of day, springs from the east, we
will welcome the rays of both; nor should national pride
induce us to reject so rich an offering.</p>

<p>But can we do nothing in return? In a general diffusion of
useful information through the various classes of society, in
activity of intellect, and fertility of resource and invention,
characterizing a highly intelligent population, we have no
reason to shrink from a comparison with any country. But
the devoted cultivators of <em>science</em>, in the United States, are
comparatively few; they are, however, rapidly increasing in
number. Among them are persons distinguished for their
capacity and attainments, and notwithstanding the local feelings
nourished by our state sovereignties, and the rival claims of
several of our larger cities, there is evidently a predisposition
towards a concentration of effort, from which we may hope
for the happiest results, with regard to the advancement of
both the science and the reputation of our country.</p>

<p>Is it not, therefore, desirable to furnish some rallying point,
some object sufficiently interesting to be compassed by common
efforts, and thus to become the basis of an enduring, common
interest? To produce these efforts, and to excite this interest,
nothing, perhaps, bids fairer than a <span class="smcap">Scientific Journal</span>.
Hitherto nearly all our exertions, of this kind, have been made
by medical gentlemen, and directed primarily to medical objects.
We are neither ignorant nor forgetful of the merits of
our various <span class="smcap">Medical Journals</span>, nor of the zeal with which, as
far as consistent with their main object, they have fostered the
physical sciences. We are aware, also, that Journals have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
been established, <em>professedly</em> deriving their materials principally
from foreign sources; that our various literary Magazines
and Reviews have given, and continue to give, some
notices of physical and mathematical subjects, and that some of
them seem even partial to these branches of knowledge: that
various limited efforts have been made, and are still making,
to publish occasional or periodical papers, devoted to mathematical
or physical subjects, and that even our newspapers
sometimes contain scientific intelligence. We are aware, also,
that some of our academies and societies of natural history,
either in Journals of their own, or through the medium of
existing magazines, communicate to the public the efforts of
their members in various branches of natural science.</p>

<p>But all these facts go only to prove the strong tendency
which exists in this country towards the cultivation of physical
science, and the inadequacy of the existing means for its
effectual promulgation.</p>

<p>Although our limits do not permit us, however much inclined,
to be more particular in commemorating the labours
and in honouring the performances (often marked by much
ability) of our predecessors and cotemporaries, there is one
effort which we are not willing to pass by without a more particular
notice; and we are persuaded that no apology is necessary
for naming the Journal of the late Dr. Bruce, of New-York,
devoted principally to mineralogy and geology.</p>

<p>No future historian of American science will fail to commemorate
this work as our earliest <em>purely scientific</em> Journal,
supported by <em>original American communications</em>.</p>

<p>Both in this country and in Europe, it was received in a very
flattering manner; it excited, <em>at home</em>, great zeal and effort in
support of the sciences which it fostered, and, <em>abroad</em>, it was
hailed as the harbinger of our future exertions. The editor
was honoured with letters on the subject of his Journal, and
with applications for it from most of the countries in Europe;
but its friends had to regret that, although conducted in a manner
perfectly to their satisfaction, it appeared only at distant
intervals, and, after the lapse of several years, never proceeded
beyond the fourth number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The hopes of its revival have now, unhappily, become completely
extinct, by the lamented death of Dr. Bruce.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>This gentleman, with an accomplished education, with extensive
acquirements in science, and great zeal for promoting
it in his own country; advantageously and extensively known
in Europe, and furnished with a correct and discriminating
mind, and a chaste, scientific taste, was so well qualified for
the task which he had undertaken, that no one can attempt to
resume those scientific labours which he has now <em>for ever</em>
relinquished, without realizing that he undertakes an arduous
enterprise, and lays himself under a heavy responsibility.
American science has much to lament in the death of Dr.
Bruce.</p>

<p>No one, it is presumed, will doubt that a Journal devoted to
science, and embracing a sphere sufficiently extensive to allure
to its support the principal scientific men of our country, is
greatly needed; if cordially supported, it will be successful,
and if successful, it will be a great public benefit.</p>

<p>Even a failure, in so good a cause, (unless it should arise
from incapacity or unfaithfulness,) cannot be regarded as dishonourable.
It may prove only that the attempt was <em>premature</em>,
and that our country is not yet ripe for such an undertaking;
for <em>without the efficient support of talent, knowledge</em>, and
<em>money, it cannot long proceed</em>. No editor can hope to carry
forward such a work without the active aid of scientific and
practical men; but, at the same time, the public have a right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to expect that he will not be sparing of his own labour, and
that his work shall be generally marked by the impress of his
own hand. To this extent the editor cheerfully acknowledges
his obligations to the public; and it will be his endeavour
faithfully to redeem his pledge.</p>

<p>Most of the periodical works of our country have been short-lived.
<em>This</em>, also, <em>may</em> perish in its infancy; and if any degree
of confidence is cherished, that it will attain a maturer age, it
is derived from the obvious and intrinsic importance of the undertaking;
from its being built upon permanent and momentous
national interests; from the evidence of a decided approbation
of the design, on the part of men of the first eminence,
obtained in the progress of an extensive correspondence; from
assurances of support, in the way of contributions, from men
of ability in many parts of the union; and from the existence
of <em>such a crisis</em> in the affairs of this country and of the world,
as appears peculiarly auspicious to the success of every wise
and good undertaking.</p>

<p>As regards the subjects of this work, it is in our power to
do much in the department of the natural history of this
country. Our Zoology has been more fully investigated than
our mineralogy and botany; but neither department is in
danger of being exhausted. The interesting travels of Lewis
and Clark have recently brought to our knowledge several
plants and animals before unknown. Foreign naturalists frequently
explore our territory; and, for the most part, convey
to Europe the fruits of their researches, while but a small
part of our own productions is examined and described by
Americans: certainly, this is little to our credit, and still less
to our advantage. Honourable exceptions to the truth of
this remark are furnished by the exertions of some gentlemen
in our principal cities, and in various other parts of the
Union.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Our botany, it is true, has been extensively and successfully
investigated; but this field is still <em>rich</em>, and rewards every new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
research with some interesting discovery. Our mineralogy,
however, is a treasure but just opened. That both science
and art may expect much advantage from this source, is sufficiently
evinced by the success which has crowned the active
efforts of a few ardent cultivators of this science: several new
species of minerals have been added to it in this country;
great numbers of American localities discovered, and interesting
additions made to our materials, for the useful and ornamental
arts. The science of mineralogy is now illustrated by
courses of lectures, and by several good cabinets in the different
states. Among the cabinets, the splendid collection of Colonel
Gibbs, now in Yale College, (a munificent <span class="fs70">DEPOSIT</span> for the
benefit of his country,) <em>stands pre-eminent</em>: it would be considered
as a very noble cabinet in any part of Europe: and its
introduction into the United States, and its <em>gratuitous</em> dedication
to the promotion of science, are equally advantageous to
the community, and honourable to its patriotic and enlightened
proprietor. Mineralogy is most intimately connected with our
arts, and especially with our agriculture.</p>

<p>Such are the disguises worn by many most useful mineral
substances, that an unskilful observer is liable to pass a thing
by, as worthless, which, if better informed, he would seize
with avidity; and, still more frequently, a worthless substance,
clothed perhaps in a brilliant and attractive exterior, excites
hopes altogether delusive, and induces expense, without a possibility
of remuneration. A diffusion of correct knowledge on
this subject is the only adequate remedy for either evil.</p>

<p>Our geology, also, presents a most interesting field of inquiry.
A grand outline has recently been drawn by Mr.
Maclure, with a masterly hand, and with a vast extent of personal
observation and labour: but to fill up the detail, both
observation and labour still more extensive are demanded;
nor can the object be effected, till more good geologists are
formed, and distributed over our extensive territory.</p>

<p>To account for the formation and changes of our globe, by
excursions of the imagination, often splendid and imposing, but
usually visionary, and almost always baseless, was, till within
half a century, the business of geological speculations; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
this research has now assumed a more sober character;
the science of geology has been reared upon numerous and
accurate observations of <em>facts</em>; and standing thus upon the basis
of induction, it is entitled to a rank among those sciences which
Lord Bacon's Philosophy has contributed to create. Geological
researches are now prosecuted, by actually exploring the
structure and arrangement of districts, countries, and continents.
The obliquity of the strata of most rocks, causing their
edges to project in many places above the surface; their
exposure in other instances, on the sides or tops of hills and
mountains; or, in consequence of the intersection of their
strata, by roads, canals, and river-courses, or by the wearing
of the ocean; or their direct perforation, by the shafts of
mines; all these causes, and others, afford extensive means of
reading the interior structure of the globe.</p>

<p>The outlines of American geology appear to be particularly
grand, simple, and instructive; and a knowledge of the important
facts, and general principles of this science, is of vast
practical use, as regards the interests of agriculture, and the
research for useful minerals. Geological and mineralogical
descriptions, and maps of particular states and districts, are
very much needed in the United States; and to excite a spirit
to furnish them will form one leading object of this journal.</p>

<p>The science of natural philosophy, with its powerful auxiliary,
mathematics, and the science of chemistry, the twin
sister of natural philosophy, are of incalculable importance to
this country. A volume would not suffice to trace their applications,
and to enumerate the instances of their utility.</p>

<p>As one which may be allowed to stand, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">instar omnium</i>, we
may mention the steam engine; that legitimate child of physical
and chemical science&mdash;at once more powerful than the
united force of the strongest and largest animals, and more
manageable than the smallest and gentlest; raising from the
bowels of the earth the massy treasures of its mines, drawing
up rivers from their channels, and pouring them, in streams
of life, into the bosom of cities; and, above all, propelling
against the currents, the winds, and the waves of the ocean,
those stupendous vessels, which combine speed with certainty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and establish upon the bosom of the deep the luxuries and
accommodations of the land.</p>

<p>The successful execution of this magnificent design was first
witnessed upon the waters of the Hudson, but is now imitated
in almost every civilized country; and it remains to be seen
whether they will emulate us by transporting, by the same
means, and against the same obstacles, the most formidable
trains of artillery.</p>

<p>The mechanical inventions of this country are numerous;
many of them are ingenious, and some are highly important.
In no way can a knowledge of them be so readily and extensively
diffused as in a scientific journal. To this object,
therefore, a part of our labours (should there be a call for it,)
will be devoted, and every necessary aid will be given by
plates and descriptions.</p>

<p>Science and art mutually assist each other; the arts furnish
facts and materials to science, and science illuminates the path
of the arts.</p>

<p>The science of mathematics, both pure and mixed, can
never cease to be interesting and important to man, as long
as the relations of quantity shall exist, as long as ships shall
traverse the ocean, as long as man shall measure the surface
or heights of the earth on which he lives, or calculate the distances
and examine the relations of the planets and stars; and
as long as the <em>iron reign of war</em> shall demand the discharge of
projectiles, or the construction of complicated defences.</p>

<p>In a word, the whole circle of physical science is directly
applicable to human wants, and constantly holds out a light to
the practical arts; it thus polishes and benefits society, and
every where demonstrates both supreme intelligence, and
harmony and beneficence of design in <span class="smcap">the Creator</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. I. Essay on Musical Temperament.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> <em>Essay on Musical Temperament.</em><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="pfs80">By Professor <span class="smcap">Fisher</span>, of Yale College.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>t is well known to those who have attended to the subject
of musical ratios, that a fixed scale of eight degrees to the octave,
which shall render all its concords perfect, is impossible.
It has been demonstrated by Dr. Smith, from an investigation
of all the positions which the major, the minor, and the half-tone
can assume, that the most perfect scales possible, of which
there are two equally so, differing only in the position of the
major and the minor tone above the key note, must have one
Vth and one 3d too flat, and consequently the supplementary
4th and VIth too sharp, by a comma. In vocal music, and in
that of perfect instruments, this defect in the scale is not perceived,
because a small change may be made in the key, whenever
the occurrence of either of those naturally imperfect intervals
renders such a change necessary to perfect harmony.
But in instruments with fixed scales, such as the guitar, the
piano-forte, and the organ, if we begin with tuning as many
concords as possible perfect, the resulting chords above-mentioned
will be necessarily false in an offensive degree. Hence
it is an important problem in practical harmonics, to distribute
these imperfections in the scale among the different chords, in
such a manner as to occasion the least possible injury to harmony.</p>

<p>But this is not the only nor the principal difficulty which
the tuner of imperfect instruments has to encounter. In order
that these instruments may form a proper accompaniment for
the voice, and be used in conjunction with perfect instruments,
it is necessary that music should be capable of being executed
on them, in all the different keys in common use; and especially
that they should be capable of those occasional modulations
which often occur in the course of the same piece. Now
only five additional sounds to the octave are usually inserted
for this purpose, between those of the natural scale, which, of
course, furnish it with only three sharps and two flats. Hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
when a greater number of flats or sharps is introduced, the
music can be executed only by striking, in the former case,
the sharp of the note next below; and, in the latter, the flat
of the note next above. But as the diatonic semitone is more
than half the major, and much more than half the minor tone,
if the additional sounds in the common artificial scale be made
perfect for one of the above employments, they must be extremely
harsh for the other. Hence arises the necessity of
adjusting the position of these five inserted sounds so that they
may make tolerable harmony, whichever way employed. A
change in these will require corresponding changes in the position
of the several degrees of the natural scale; so that it is
highly probable that the best scheme of temperament will
leave no concord, either of the natural or artificial scale, absolutely
perfect.</p>

<p>In adjusting the imperfections of the scale, the three following
considerations have been usually taken into view.</p>

<p>I. One object to be aimed at is, to make the sum of the temperaments
of all the concords the least possible. Since experience
teaches us that the harshness of a given concord increases
with its temperament, it is obvious that of two systems
which agree in other respects, the best is that in which the
sum of the temperaments is least.</p>

<p>II. When other things are equal, the best adjustment of the
imperfections of the scale is that which diminishes the harmoniousness
of all the different concords proportionally. The
succession of a worse to a better harmony, is justly regarded
by several of the best writers on this subject, as one of the
principal causes of offence to the ear, in instruments imperfectly
tuned.</p>

<p>III. When different chords of the same kind are of unequally
frequent occurrence, there is an advantage, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>,
in giving the greatest temperament to that which occurs most
seldom. This important consideration has indeed been neglected
by Dr. Smith, in the systems which he recommends,
both for his changeable and the common fixed scale; as it is,
also, by the numerous advocates of the system of equal semitones.
But many authors on temperament, and most instrument-makers,
pay a vague regard to it. Their aim has been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
although in a loose and conjectural manner, to make the prominent
chords of the simplest keys the nearest to perfection,
whilst a greater temperament is thrown upon those which occur
only in the more complex keys. Thus Dr. Young, in the
Philos. Trans. for 1800, recommends a scheme which increases
the temperament of the IIIds, on the key note of the
successive keys, as we modulate by fifths from C, nearly in
arithmetical progression. Earl Stanhope assigns as a reason
for the small temperament which is given to several of the
IIIds in his system, that they are on the tonic of the simpler
keys. The irregularities in Mr. Hawkes's scheme may be
traced to the same cause. And, with the instrument-makers,
it is a favourite maxim to lay the wolf, as they term it, where
it will be most seldom heard.</p>

<p>But if the above consideration deserves any weight at all, it
deserves to be accurately investigated. Not only ought the
relative frequency of different chords to be ascertained with
the greatest accuracy, of which the nature of the subject is susceptible,
but the degree of weight which this consideration
ought to have, when compared with the two others above-mentioned,
should be determined: for it is plain that neither of
them ought to be ever left out of view.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the principal design of the following propositions
will be to investigate the actual frequency of occurrence of
different chords in practice; and from this and the two other
above-mentioned considerations united, to deduce the best
system of temperament for a scale, containing any given number
of sounds to the octave, and particularly for the common
Douzeave, or scale of twelve degrees.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition I.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All consonances may be regarded, without any sensible error
in practice, as equally harmonious in their kinds, when
equally tempered; and when unequally tempered, within
certain limits, as having their harmoniousness diminished in
the direct ratio of their temperaments.</p></div>

<p>As different consonances, when perfect, are not pleasing to
the ear in an equal degree, some approaching nearer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
nature of discords than others, so a set of tempered consonances,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>, will be best constituted when their harmoniousness
is diminished <em>proportionally</em>. Suppose, for example,
that the agreeable effects of the Vth, IIId, and 3d, when
perfect, are as any unequal numbers, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>; the best arrangement
of a tempered scale, other things being equal, would
be, not that in which the agreeable effect of the Vth was reduced
to an absolute level with that of the IIId, or 3d, but
when they were so tempered that their agreeable effects on
the ear might be expressed by
<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka"><i>m</i></span>
  <span class="blka over"><i>n</i></span>
</span>&nbsp;<i>a</i>,&nbsp;

</p>

<p>That different consonances, in this sense, are equally harmonious
in their kinds, when equally tempered, or, at least,
sufficiently so for every practical purpose, may be illustrated
in the following manner:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p013.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Let the lines AB, <i>ab</i>, represent the times of vibration of
two tempered unisons. Whatever be the ratio of AB to <i>ab</i>,
whether rational or irrational, it is obvious that the successive
vibrations will alternately recede from and approach each
other, till they very nearly coincide; and, that during one of
these periods, the longer vibration, AB, has gained <em>one</em> of the
shorter. Let the points, A, B, &amp;c. represent the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
successive times of vibration of the lower; and <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, &amp;c. those
of the higher of the tempered unisons. Let the arc AGN..VA
be a part of a circle, representing one period of their
pulses, and let the points A, <i>a</i>, be the middle points of the
times of those vibrations which approach the nearest to a
coincidence. It is obvious that the dislocations <i>b</i>B, <i>c</i>C, &amp;c. of
the successive pulses, increase in a ratio which is very nearly
that of their distances from A, or <i>a</i>. Now if the pulses exactly
coincided, the unisons would be perfect; and the same would
be equally true, if the pulses of the one bisected, or divided
in any other constant ratio, those of the other; as clearly
appears from observation. It is, therefore, not the absolute
magnitude, as asserted by Dr. Smith, but the <em>variableness</em> of the
successive dislocations, B<i>b</i>, C<i>c</i>, &amp;c. which renders the imperfect
unisons discordant; and the magnitude of the successive
increments of these dislocations is the measure of the degree
of discordance heard in the unisons.</p>

<p>If now the time of vibration in each is doubled, AC, <i>ac</i>, &amp;c.
will represent the times of vibration of imperfect unisons an
octave below, and the successive dislocations will be C<i>c</i>, E<i>e</i>,
&amp;c. only half as frequent as before. But the unisons AE, <i>ae</i>,
will be equally harmonious with AB, <i>ab</i>; because, although
the successive dislocations are less frequent than before, yet
the coincidences C′<i>c′</i>, E′<i>e′</i> of the corresponding perfect unisons
are less frequent in the same ratio.</p>

<p>Suppose, in the second place, that the time of vibration is
doubled, in only one of the unisons, <i>ab</i>; and that the times
become AB and <i>ac</i>, or those of imperfect octaves. These will
also be equally harmonious in their kind with the unisons AB,
<i>ab</i>. For, although the dislocations C<i>c</i>, E<i>e</i>, &amp;c. are but half
as numerous as before, the coincidences of the corresponding
perfect octaves will be but half as numerous. The dislocations
which remain are the same as those of the imperfect unisons;
and if some of the dislocations are struck out, and the
increments of successive ones thus increased, no greater
change is made in the nature of the imperfect than of the
perfect consonance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>If, thirdly, we omit two-thirds of the pulses of the lower
unison, retaining the octave <i>ac</i> of the last case, we shall have
AD, <i>ac</i>, the times of vibration of imperfect Vths, to which,
and to all other concords, the same reasoning may be applied
as above. It may be briefly exhibited thus; since the intermission
of the coincidences C′<i>c′</i>, E′<i>e′</i> of the perfect unisons,
an octave below A′B′, does not render the Vth A′D′G′ <i>a′c′e′g′</i> less
perfect than the unison A′<i>c′</i> <i>a′c′</i>, each being perfect in its kind;
so neither does the intermission of the corresponding dislocations
C<i>c</i>, E<i>e</i>, of the tempered unisons, in the imperfect Vth,
ADG, <i>aceg</i>, render it less harmonious in its kind than the tempered
unison AB, <i>ab</i>, from which it is derived in exactly the
same manner that the perfect Vth is derived from the perfect
unison.</p>

<p>The consonances thus derived, as has been shown by Dr.
Smith, will have the same periods, and consequently the same
beats, with the imperfect unisons. It is obvious, likewise, that
they will all be equally tempered. Let <i>m</i> AB, and <i>n</i> <i>ab</i>, be a
general expression for the times of vibration of any such consonance.
The tempering ratio of an imperfect consonance is
always found by dividing the ratio of the vibrations of the imperfect
by that of the corresponding perfect consonance. But

<span class="nowrap">
<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka"><i>m</i> AB</span>
  <span class="blka over"><i>n</i> <i>ab</i></span>
</span>&nbsp; ÷

<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka"><i>m</i></span>
  <span class="blka over"><i>n</i></span>
</span>&nbsp; =

<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka">AB</span>
  <span class="blka over"><i>ab</i></span>
</span>&nbsp;;
</span>
which is evidently the tempering ratio of
the imperfect unisons.</p>

<p>Hence, so far as any reasoning, founded on the abstract nature
of coexisting pulses can be relied on, (for, in a case of
this kind, rigid demonstration can scarcely be expected,) we
are led to conclude that the harmoniousness of different consonances
is proportionally diminished when they are equally
tempered.</p>

<p>The remaining part of the proposition, viz. that consonances
differently tempered have their harmoniousness diminished,
or their harshness increased, in the direct ratio of their
temperaments, will be evident, when we consider that the
temperament of any consonance is the sole cause of its harshness,
and that the effect ought to be proportioned to its ade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>quate
cause. We may add, that the rapidity of the beats, in
a given consonance, increases very nearly in the ratio of the
temperament; and universal experience shows, that increasing
the rapidity of the beats of the same consonance, increases
its harshness. This is on the supposition that the consonance
is not varied so much as to interfere with any other whose
ratio is equally simple.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> We may hence infer, that in every system of temperament
which preserves the octaves perfect, each consonance is
equally harmonious, in its kind, with its complement to the
octave, and its compounds with octaves. For the tempering
ratio of the complement of any concord to the octave, is the
same with that of the concord itself, differing only in its sign,
which does not sensibly affect the harmony or the rate of
beating; while the tempering ratio of the compounds with
octaves is not only the same, but with the same sign.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium 1.</em></h3>

<p>There is no point in harmonics, concerning which theorists
have been more divided in opinion than in regard to the true
measure of equal harmony, in consonances of different kinds.
Euler maintains, that the more simple a consonance is, the
less temperament it will bear; and this seems to have ever
been the general opinion of practical musicians.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Dr. Smith,
on the contrary, asserts, and has attempted to demonstrate,
that the simpler will bear a much greater temperament than the
more complex consonances. The foregoing proposition has,
at least, the merit of taking the middle ground between these
discordant opinions. If admitted, it will greatly simplify the
whole subject, and will reduce the labour of rendering all the
concords in three octaves as equally harmonious as possible,
which occupies so large a portion of Dr. Smith's volume, to a
single short proposition. Dr. Smith's measure of equal harmony,
viz. equal numbers of short cycles in the intervals between
the successive beats, seems designed, not to render the
different consonances proportionally harmonious, but to reduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the simpler to an absolute level, in point of agreeableness, with
the more complex; which, as has been shown, is not the object
to be aimed at in adjusting their comparative temperaments.
But, in truth, his measure is far more favourable to
the complex consonances than equal harmony, even in this
sense, would require; and, in a great number of instances,
leads to the grossest absurdities. Two consonances, according
to him, are equally harmonious, when their temperaments
are inversely as the products of the least numbers expressing
their perfect ratio. If so, the VIII + 3d, whose ratio is <small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>12</sub></small>,
when tempered <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub></small> of a comma, and the unison, whose ratio is
<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub></small>, when tempered 3 commas, are equally harmonious. But
all who have the least experience in tempered consonances
will pronounce, at once, that the former could scarcely be distinguished
by the nicest ear from the corresponding perfect
concord, while the latter would be a most offensive discord.
One instance more shall suffice. The temperaments to render
the VIII + Vth, and the VIII + 6th equally harmonious,
are laid down in his tables to be as 80 : 3. We will now suppose
an instrument perfectly tuned in Dr. Smith's manner, and
furnished with all the additional sounds which constitute his
changeable scale. In this system, the IIIds, and consequently
the VIII + 6ths, are tempered <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub></small> of a comma; which, so far
from being offensive, will be positively agreeable to the ear.
This cannot be doubted by those who admit that the VIII +
6ths in the common imperfect scales, when tempered at a medium
nearly seven times as much, make tolerable harmony.
Yet, according to the theory which we are opposing, the
VIII + Vth will be equally harmonious when tempered nearly
a minor semitone. Now let any one, even with the common
instruments, whenever an VIII + Vth occurs, strike the semitone
next above or below: for example, instead of playing
C, <i>g</i>, let him play C, <i>g</i><img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />;
instead of A, <i>e</i>, let him play A, <i>e</i><img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />,
&amp;c. and compare the harmony of these with that of the VIII +
6ths, if he wants any farther evidence that Dr. Smith's measure
of equal harmony is without foundation.</p>

<p>It may be thought, that even the measure of equal harmony
laid down in the proposition, is more favourable to the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>plex
consonances than the conclusions of experience will warrant.
But when it is asserted by practical musicians, that the
octave will bear less tempering than the Vth, the Vth less than
the IIId, &amp;c., they doubtless intend to estimate the temperament
by the rate of beating, and to imply, that when different
consonances to the same base are made to beat equally fast,
the simpler are more offensive than the more complex consonances.
This is entirely consistent with the proposition; for
when equally tempered, the more complex consonances will
beat more rapidly than the more simple; if on the same base,
very nearly in the ratio of their major terms. (Smith's Har.
Prop. XI. Cor. 4.) If, for example, an octave, a Vth, and a
IIId on the same base were made to beat with a rapidity which
is as the numbers 2, 3, and 5, no unprejudiced ear would probably
pronounce the octave less harmonious in its kind than
the IIId.</p>

<p>To those, on the other hand, who may incline to a measure
of equal harmony between that laid down in the proposition
and that of Dr. Smith, on account of the rapidity of the beats
of the more complex consonances, it maybe sufficient to reply,
that if the beats of a more complex consonance are more
rapid than those of a simpler one, when both are equally tempered,
those of the latter, cæteris paribus, are more <em>distinct</em>.
It is the distinctness of the undulations, in tempered consonances,
which is one of the principal causes of offence to the
ear.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium 2.</em></h3>

<p>It will be proper to explain, in this place, the notation of musical
intervals, which will be adopted in the following pages.
It is well known that musical intervals are as the logarithms of
their corresponding ratios. If, therefore, the octave be represented
by .30103, the log. of 2, the value of the Vth will
be expressed by .17509; that of the major tone by .05115;
that of the comma by .00540, &amp;c. But in order to avoid the
prefixed ciphers, in calculations where so small intervals as
the temperaments of different concords are concerned, we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
multiply each of these values by 100,000, which will give a
set of integral values having the same ratio. The octave will
now become 30103, the comma 540, &amp;c.; and, in general, when
temperaments are hereafter expressed by numbers, they are
to be considered as so many 540ths of a comma. Had more
logarithmic places been taken, the intervals would have been
expressed with greater accuracy; but it was supposed that the
additional accuracy would not compensate for the increased labour
of computation which it would occasion. This notation
has been adopted by Dr. Robinson, in the article Temperament,
(Encyc. Brit. Supplement;) and for every practical purpose,
is as much superior to that proposed by Mr. Farey, in parts
of the Schisma, lesser fraction and minute,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as all decimal
measures necessarily are, to those which consist of different
denominations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition II.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In adjusting the imperfections of the scale, so as to render all
the consonances as equally harmonious as possible, only the
simple consonances, such as the Vth, IIId, and 3d, with their
complements to and compounds with the octave, can be regarded.</p></div>

<p>It has been generally assigned as the reason for neglecting
the consonances, usually termed discords, in ascertaining the
best scheme of temperament, that they are of less frequent occurrence
than the concords. This, however, if it were the
only reason, would lead us, not to neglect them entirely, but
merely to give them a less degree of influence than the concords,
in proportion as they are less used.</p>

<p>A consideration which seems not to have been often noticed,
renders it impossible to pay them any regard in harmonical
computations. All such computations must proceed on the
supposition that within the limits to which the temperaments
of the different consonances extend, they become harsher as
their temperaments are increased. It is evident that any consonance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>may be tempered so much as to become better by
having its temperament increased, in consequence of its approaching
as near to some other perfect ratio, the terms of
which are equally small; or perhaps much nearer some perfect
ratio whose terms are not proportionally larger. For example,
after we have sharpened the Vth more than 3 commas,
it becomes more harmonious, as approaching much nearer to
the perfect ratio <small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub></small>. In this, however, and the other concords,
the value of the nearest perfect ratios in small numbers, varies
so much from the ratios of these concords, and the consequent
limits within which the last part of Prop. I. holds true, are so
wide that there is no hazard in making it a basis of calculation.
And if there be a few exceptions to this, in some systems, in
which the temperaments of a few of the concords become so
large as to approach nearer to some other perfect ratio, whose
terms are nearly as small as those of the perfect concord,
although they might become more harmonious, by having their
temperament increased, yet their effect in <em>melody</em> would be
still more impaired; so that the concords may all be considered
as subjected to the same rule of calculation.</p>

<p>But the limits within which the second part of Prop. I.
holds true, with regard to the more complex consonances, are
much more limited. We cannot, for instance, sharpen the
7th, whose ratio is 9 : 16 more than ½ a comma, without rendering
it more harmonious, as approaching nearer another perfect
ratio which is simpler; that of 5 : 9. Yet the difference
between these two 7ths is so trifling that they have never
received distinct names; and, indeed, their effect on the ear
in melody would not be sensibly different.</p>

<p>Again, the 5th, whose perfect ratio has been generally laid
down as 45 : 64, but which is in reality 25 : 36,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> cannot be
sharpened more than ⅓ of a comma, before it becomes more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
harmonious by having its temperament increased, as approaching
nearer the simpler ratio 7 : 10. At the same time, the
effect of this interval in melody would not be sensibly varied.
The limits, within which the harmoniousness of the IVth is
inversely as its temperament, are still narrower.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that no inference can be drawn from the
temperaments of such consonances as the 7th, 5th, IVth, &amp;c.
respecting their real harmoniousness. The other perfect ratios
which have nearly the same value with those of these
chords, and which are in equally simple terms, are so numerous
that by increasing their temperament they alternately become
more and less harmonious; and in a manner so irregular,
that to attempt to subject them to calculation, with the
concords, would be in vain. Even when unaltered, they may
be considered either as greater temperaments of more simple,
or less temperaments of more complex ratios. Suppose the
5th, for example, to be flattened ⅕ of a comma: shall it be
considered as deriving its character from the perfect ratio
25 : 36, and be regarded as flattened 108; or shall it be referred
to the perfect ratio 7 : 10, and considered as sharpened
239? No one can tell.&mdash;On the whole, it is manifest that no
consonances more complex than those included in the proposition,
can be regarded in adjusting the temperaments of the
scale.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition III.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The best scale of sounds, which renders the harmony of all
the concords as nearly equal as possible, is that in which the
Vths are flattened <small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small>, and the IIIds and 3ds, each <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> of a
comma.</p></div>

<p>The octave must be kept perfect, for reasons which have
satisfied all theoretical and practical harmonists, how widely
soever their opinions have differed in other respects. Admitting
equal temperament to be the measure of equal harmony,
the complements of the Vth, IIId, and 3d, to the octave,
and their compounds with octaves will be equally harmoni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>ous
in their kinds with these concords respectively; according
to the corollary of Prop I.</p>

<p>Hence we have only to find those temperaments of the Vths,
IIIds, and 3ds, in the compass of one octave, which will render
them all, as nearly as possible, equally harmonious. The
temperaments of the different concords of the same name
ought evidently to be rendered equal; since, otherwise, their
harmony cannot be equal. This can be effected only by rendering
the major and minor tones equal, and preserving the
equality of the two semitones. If this is done, the temperament
of all the IIIds will be equal, since they will each be the
sum of two equal tones. For a similar reason the 3ds, and
consequently the Vths, formed by the addition of IIIds, and
3ds, will be equally tempered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p022.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In order to reduce the octave to five equal and variable tones,
and two equal and variable semitones, we will suppose the
intervals of the untempered octave to be represented by
the parts CD, DE, &amp;c. of the line C<i>c</i>. Denoting the comma by
<i>c</i>, we will suppose the tone DE, which is naturally minor, to
be increased by any variable quantity, <i>x</i>; then, by the foregoing
observations, the other minor tone, GA, must be increased
by the same quantity. As the major tones must be rendered
equal to the minor, their increment will be <i>x</i> &ndash; <i>c</i>. As the
octave is to be perfect, the variation of the two semitones must
be the same with that of the five tones, with the contrary sign;
and as they are to be equally varied, the decrement of each
will be

<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka">5<i>x</i> &ndash; 3<i>c</i></span>
  <span class="blka over">&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
</span>&nbsp;

; or what amounts to the same thing, the
increment of each will be

<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka">3<i>c</i> &ndash; 5<i>x</i></span>
  <span class="blka over">&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
</span>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The several concords of the same name in this octave are
now affected with equal and variable temperaments. The
common increment of the IIIds will be 2<i>x</i> &ndash; <i>c</i>; that of the 3ds
<span class="nowrap">½ · <span class="over"><i>c</i> &ndash; 3<i>x</i></span>;</span> and consequently that of the Vths
<span class="nowrap">½ · <span class="over"><i>x</i> &ndash; <i>c</i></span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>In adjusting these variable temperaments, so as to render
the harmony of the concords of <em>different</em> kinds, as nearly equal
as possible, we immediately discover that, as the Vth is composed
of the IIId and 3d, the temperaments of the three cannot
all be equal. When the temperaments of the IIId and
3d have the same sign, that of the Vths must be equal to their
sum; and, when they have contrary signs, to their difference.
Hence the temperament of one of these three concords is
necessarily equal to the sum of that of the other two. This
being fixed, the temperaments, and consequently, (by Prop. I.)
the discordance of the different consonances is the most equably
divided possible, when the two smaller temperaments, whose
sum is equal to the greater, are made equal to each other.
The problem contains three cases.</p>

<p>1. When the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have the
same sign, they ought to be equal to each other. Making
<span class="nowrap">2<i>x</i> &ndash; <i>c</i> = ½ · <span class="over"><i>c</i> &ndash; 3<i>x</i></span>,</span> we obtain <span class="nowrap"><i>x</i> = <small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> <i>c</i>,</span> which, substituted in
the general expressions for the temperaments of the Vth, IIId,
and 3d, makes their increments equal to &ndash;<small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> <i>c</i>, &ndash;<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> <i>c</i>, &ndash;<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> <i>c</i>,
respectively.</p>

<p>2. Let the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have contrary
signs: and first, let that of the IIIds be the greater. Then
the former ought to be double of the latter, in order that the
temperament of the Vths and and 3ds may be equal. Hence we
have <span class="nowrap">2<i>x</i> &ndash; <i>c</i> = &ndash; 2 · ½ · <span class="over"><i>c</i> &ndash; 3<i>x</i></span>;</span> whence <i>x</i> is found = 0; and
by substitution as before, the required temperament of the
IIId = &ndash; <i>c</i>; of the Vth &ndash; ½ <i>c</i>, and of the 3d ½ <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>3. Let the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have contrary
signs, as before; and let that of the 3d be the greater.
Making <span class="nowrap">½ · <span class="over"><i>c</i> &ndash; 3<i>x</i></span> = &ndash;2 · <span class="over">2<i>x</i> &ndash; <i>c</i></span>,</span> we obtain <i>x</i> = <small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub></small> <i>c</i>; which
gives, by substitution, the temperaments of the 3d, Vth, and
IIId &ndash; <small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></small> <i>c</i>, &ndash; <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub></small> <i>c</i>, and <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub></small> <i>c</i>, respectively.</p>

<p>Each of these results makes the harmony of all the consonances
as nearly equal as possible; but as the sum of the
temperaments in the first case is much the least, it follows that
the temperaments stated in the proposition constitute the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
scheme of intervals for the natural scale, in which the harmony
of all the different consonances is rendered as nearly equal as
possible.</p>

<p><em>Cor. 1.</em> In the same manner it may be shown that these
temperaments are the best, among those which approach as
nearly as possible to equal harmony, for the <em>artificial</em> scale;
provided that it is furnished with distinct sounds for all the
sharps and flats in common use. By inserting a sound between
F and G, making the interval F<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />G equal to either of the semitones
found above, the intervals, reckoned from G as a key
note, will be exactly the same in respect to their temperaments,
as the corresponding ones reckoned from C. The same thing
holds, whatever be the number of flats and sharps. It is supposed,
however, that the flat of a note is never used for the
sharp of that next below, or the contrary; and hence this
scheme of temperament would only be adapted to an instrument,
furnished with all the degrees of the enharmonic scale;
or, at least, with as many as are in common use.</p>

<p><em>Cor. 2.</em> This scale will differ but little in practice from the
one deduced, with so much labour, by Dr. Smith, from his
criterion of equal harmony; which flattens the Vths <small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>18</sub></small>, the
IIIds <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub></small>, and the 3ds <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></small> of a comma. The several differences
are only <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>126</sub></small>, <small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>63</sub></small>, and <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>42</sub></small> of a comma. Hence, as his measure
of equal harmony differs so widely from that of Proposition I.
we may infer that the consideration of equalizing the harmony
of the concords of different names can have very little practical
influence on the temperaments of the scale. Should it,
therefore, be maintained that the criterion laid down in Prop.
I. is not mathematically accurate; yet, as it must be allowed,
in the most unfavourable view, to correspond far better with
the decisions of experience than that of Doctor Smith, the
chance is, that, at the lowest estimate, the temperaments deduced
from it approach much more nearly to correctness.
Hence it is manifest that equal temperament may be made,
<em>without any sensible error in practice</em>, the criterion of equal
harmony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Scholium 3.</em></h3>

<p>Although the foregoing would be the best division of the
musical scale, if our sole object were to render the harmony
of its concords as nearly equal as possible, yet the two other
considerations, stated at the beginning of the essay, must by
no means be neglected, as has been done by Dr. Smith. It
seems to be universally admitted, that the sum of the temperaments
may be increased to a certain extent, in order to equalize
the harmony of the concords; otherwise the natural scale of
major and minor tones, which makes the sum of the temperaments
of the Vths, IIIds, and 3ds but 2 commas, ought to be
left unaltered. Yet how far this principle ought to be carried,
may be a matter of doubt. If we make the IIIds perfect, and
flatten the Vths and 3ds each ¼ <i>c</i>, according to the old system
of mean tones, we shall have the smallest aggregate of temperaments
which admits of the different concords of the same
name being rendered equally imperfect; but this amounts to
2½ commas. Thus far, however, it seems evidently proper to
proceed. If we go still farther, and endeavour to equalize
the harmony of the concords of <em>different</em> names, it may be questioned
whether nearly as much is not lost as gained; for the
aggregate temperaments are increased, in Dr. Smith's scale,
to 2⅔ <i>c</i>, and in that of the above proposition to 2<small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> <i>c</i>. The
system of mean tones, although more unequal in its harmony
when but two notes are struck at once, yet when the chords
are played full, as they generally are on the organ, never
offends the ear by a transition from a better to a worse harmony.
For every <em>triad</em> is equally harmonious; being composed
of a perfect IIId, and a Vth and 3d, tempered each ¼ <i>c</i>,
or of their complements to, or compounds with octaves, which,
in their kinds, are equally harmonious.</p>

<p>Again, if different chords, in practice, vary in the frequency
of their occurrence, this will be a sufficient reason for deviating
from the system of equal temperament. Suppose, for example,
that a given sum of temperament is to be divided between
two Vths, one of which occurs in playing ten times as often as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the other: there can be no doubt that the greater part of the
temperament ought to be thrown upon the latter. Hence it
becomes an important problem to ascertain, with some degree
of precision, the relative frequency with which different consonances
occur in practice. Before proceeding to a direct investigation
of this problem, it may be observed, in general,
that such a difference manifestly exists. In a given key, it
cannot have escaped the most superficial observer, that the
most frequent combination of sounds is the common chord on
the tonic; that the next after this is that on the dominant, and
the third, that on the subdominant. Perhaps scarcely a piece
of music can be found, in which this order of frequency does
not hold true. It is equally true that some signatures occur
oftener than others. That of one sharp will be found to be
more used, in the major mode, than any other; and, in general,
the more simple keys will be found of more frequent occurrence
than those which have more flats or sharps. These
differences are not the result of accident. The tonic, dominant,
and subdominant, are obviously the most prominent notes
in the scale, and must always be the fundamental bases of more
chords than either of the others; while the greater ease of
playing on the simpler keys will always be a reason with composers
for setting a larger part of their music on these, than
on the more difficult keys. It is observable, that the greater
part of musical compositions, whether of the major or minor
mode, is reducible to two kinds: that in which the base chiefly
moves between the tonic and its octave, and that in which the
base moves between the dominant and subdominant of the key.
The former class, in the major mode, are almost universally
set on the key of one sharp; the latter, generally on the natural
key, or that of two sharps. In the minor mode, the former
class have usually the signature of two flats, or the natural
key; the latter, that of one flat. Hence the three former
keys will comprise the greater part of the music in the major
mode, and the three latter, of that in the minor mode, in every
promiscuous collection. But if we were even to suppose each
of the chords in the same key, and each of the signatures, of
equally frequent occurrence, some chords would occur much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
oftener, as forming an essential part of the harmony of <em>more
keys</em> than others. The Vth DA, for example, forms one of
the essential chords of six different keys; while the Vth
G<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />D<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> forms a part only of the single key of four sharps.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition IV.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To find a set of numbers, expressing the ratio of the probable
number of times that each of the different consonances in
the scale will occur, in any set of musical compositions.</p></div>

<p>This can be done only by investigating their actual frequency
of occurrence in a collection of pieces for the instrument to be
tuned, sufficiently extensive and diversified to serve as a specimen
of music for the same instrument in general. This may
appear, at first view, an endless task; and it would be really
such, were we to take music promiscuously, and count all the
consonances which the base makes with the higher parts, and
the higher parts with each other. But it appears, from Prop.
I. Cor. that all the positions and inversions of a chord, when
the octaves are kept perfect, are equally harmonious with the
chord itself. The Vth, for example, which makes one of the
consonances in a common harmonic triad, is equally harmonious
in its kind, with the V + VIII, which takes its place in the
3d position of this triad, and with the 4th in its second inversion.
Hence, instead of counting single consonances, we have only
to count chords; and this is done with the greatest ease, by
means of the figures of the thorough base. The labour will
be still farther abridged by reducing the derivative chords,
such as the 6, the <small><sup>6</sup>/<sub>4</sub></small>, &amp;c. to their proper roots, as they are
taken down. But even after these reductions, the labour of
numbering the different chords in a sufficiently extensive set of
compositions, to establish, with any degree of certainty, the
relative frequency of the different signatures, would be very
irksome. A method, however, presents itself, which renders
it sufficient to examine the chords in such a set of pieces only
as will give their chance of occurrence in <em>two</em> keys&mdash;a major,
and its relative minor.</p>

<p>It will be evident to all who are much conversant with musical
compositions, that the <em>internal structure</em> of all pieces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the same mode, whatever be their signature, is much the same.
There is scarcely more difference, for example, in the relative
frequency of different chords in the natural key, and in that of
two sharps, or two flats, than there is in different pieces on the
same key. If the Vth CG on the tonic has to the Vth EB on
the mediant in the natural key, any given ratio of frequency
<i>m</i> : <i>n</i>, the relative frequency of the Vth DA on the tonic, and
the Vth F<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> on the mediant in the key of two sharps, will
not sensibly differ from that of <i>m</i> : <i>n</i>. Hence, if we examine a
sufficient number of pieces to establish the relative frequency
of the different consonances in one major and its relative minor
key, and, by a much more extensive investigation, ascertain the
relative frequency of occurrence of the different signatures, it
is evident, that by multiplying this last series of numbers into
the first, and adding those products which belong to chords terminated
by the same letters, we shall have a series of numbers
expressing the chance of occurrence in favour of each of the
consonances of the scale, when <em>all</em> the keys are taken into
view.</p>

<p>It was judged that 200 scores, taken promiscuously from all
the varieties of music for the organ,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> would afford a set of
numbers expressing, with sufficient accuracy, the chance that
a given consonance will occur in a single major, and its relative
minor key. Accordingly 200 scores were examined, 150 in
the major, and 50 in the minor mode, (as it will appear hereafter
that this is nearly the ratio of their frequency) of the
various species of music for the organ, comprising a proper
share both of the simpler and of the more rapid and chromatic
movements. As the selecting and reducing to their proper
keys all the occasional modulations which occur in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
piece would render the labour of ascertaining the relative frequency
of different signatures very tedious, it was thought best
to consider all those modulations which are too transient to be
indicated by a new signature, as belonging to the same key.
This will account for the occurrence of the chords in the following
table, which are affected by flats and sharps.</p>

<p>The minim, or the crotchet, was taken for unity, according
to the rapidity of the movement. Bases of greater or less
length had their proper values assigned them; although mere
notes of passage, which bore no proper harmony, were generally
disregarded. The scores were taken promiscuously
from all the different keys; and were reduced, when taken
down, to the same tonic; the propriety of which will evidently
appear from the foregoing remarks. The following table contains
the result of the investigation.</p>

<p>The following anomalous chords were found in the major
mode, and are subjoined, to make the list complete:</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
8 <img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />5ths on C, and 1 on D.<br />
5 <small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>4</sub></small>ths on D, 2 on E, and 1 on G.<br />
</p>

<p>The left hand column of the foregoing table contains the
fundamental bases of the several chords. When any number
is annexed to the letter denoting the fundamental, it denotes
the quality of some other note belonging to the chord. E III,
for example, denotes that the various chords on E, which
stand against it, have their third sharped; G 3, that the third,
which is naturally major, is to be taken minor, &amp;c. Of the two
columns in each of the four remaining pairs, the left contains
the number of chords belonging to each root, of the kind specified
at the top, which were found in 150 scores in the major
mode; and the right, the corresponding results of the examination
of 50 scores in the minor mode. The diminished triad,
which is used in harmonical progression like the other triads,
has its lowest note considered as its fundamental. The diminished
7th, in the few instances in which it occurred, was considered
as the first inversion of the <small><sup>9</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small>th, agreeably to the French
classification, and was accordingly reduced to that head.</p>

<p>From this table, the number of times that each consonance
of two notes would actually occur, were the 200 scores played,
is easily computed. We will suppose three notes, besides
octaves, to be played to each chord. The octaves played
it is unnecessary to take into the computation, as it would only
multiply the number of consonances whose temperament is the
same, in the same ratio, and would have no effect on the <em>ratio</em>
of the numbers expressing the frequency of the different consonances.
In the chord of the 7th, which naturally consists of
four notes, we will suppose, for the sake of uniformity, that
one is omitted; and as the 7th ought always to be struck, we
will suppose the Vth and IIId of the base to be omitted, each
half the number of times in which this chord occurs. Considered
as composed of three distinct notes, neither of which is
an octave of either of the others, each chord will contain three
distinct consonances. The common chord on C, for example,
will contain the Vth CG, the IIId CE, and the 3d EG. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<small><sup>9</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> on C will contain the VII CB, the IX, or (which must have
the same temperament) the IId CD, and the 3d BD. Reducing
all these consonances to their proper places, and adding
those of the same name which have the same degree for their
base, we obtain the following results:</p>

<p>It was thought best to exhibit a complete table of all the
consonances which occurred in the 200 scores examined;
although (Prop. II.) only the concords in the upper half of the
table can be regarded in forming a system of temperament.
For the more frequent consonances, this table may be regarded
as founded on a sufficiently extensive induction to be tolerably
accurate. For the more unfrequent chords, and especially for
those which arise from unusual modulations, it expresses the
chance of occurrence with very little accuracy; and it is
doubtless the fact that a more extensive investigation would
include some chords not found at all in this list. But it must
be recollected, on the other hand, that the influence of these
unusual chords on the resulting system of temperament would
be insensible, could their chance of occurrence be determined
with the greatest accuracy.</p>

<p>But none of the numbers in the foregoing table by any means
expresses the chance that a given interval will occur, considering
<em>all</em> the keys in which it is found. For example, the
Vth CG on the tonic of the natural key, in music written on
this key, is the one of most frequent occurrence, its chance
being expressed by 1807; but in the key of two flats, it becomes
the Vth on the supertonic, and its chance of occurrence
is only as 197. Hence the problem can be completed only by
finding a set of numbers which shall express, with some degree
of accuracy, the relative frequency of different signatures.</p>

<p>An examination of 1600 scores, comprising four entire collections
of music for the organ and voice, by the best European
composers, besides many miscellaneous pieces, afforded

<p class="p1" />
<p>The chance of occurrence for any chord varies as the frequency
of the key to which it belongs, and as the number belonging
to the place which it holds, as referred to the tonic, in
Table II., jointly. Hence the chance of its occurrence in all
the keys in which it is found, is as the sum of the products of
the numbers in Table III., each into such a number of Table
II. as corresponds to its place in that key. To give a specimen
of the manner in which this calculation is to be conducted,
the numbers belonging to the major mode in the three first
divisions of Table II. are first to be multiplied throughout by
176, which expresses the relative frequency of the major mode
of the natural key. They are then to be multiplied throughout
by 322, which expresses the frequency of the key of one
sharp. But the first product, which expresses the frequency
of the Vth on the tonic, now becomes GD, and must be added,
not to the first, but to the fifth, in the last row of products.
The product into 59, expressing the frequency of the Vth on
the mediant, becomes BF<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, an interval not found among the
essential chords of the natural key. In general, the products
of the numbers in Table III. into those in Table II. are to be
considered as belonging, not to the letters against which these
multipliers stand, but to those which have the same position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<em>with regard to their successive tonics</em>, as these have with regard
to C. Whenever an interval occurs, affected with a new flat
or sharp, it is to be considered as the commencement of a new
succession of products. The IIId C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />E<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, for example, does
not occur at all till we come to the key of two sharps, and even
then only in occasional modulations, corresponding to the
IIId on B in the natural key, whose multiplier is 10. In the
key of 3 sharps it becomes another accidental chord, answering
to the IIId on E in the key of C, and consequently has 40
for its multiplier. It is only in the key of 6 sharps, that it becomes
a constituent chord of the key; when if that key were
ever used, it would correspond to the IIId GB on the dominant
of the natural key.</p>

<p>After all the products have been taken and reduced to their
proper places, in the manner exemplified above, a similar
operation must be repeated with the numbers in the second
column of Table III. and those in the second columns in the
three first divisions of Table II.</p>

<p>The necessity of keeping the major, and its relative minor
key, distinct, will be evident, when we consider that the
several keys in the minor mode do not follow the same law of
frequency as in the major; as is manifest from the observations
in Schol. Prop. III. and as clearly appears from an inspection
of Table III.</p>

<p>But in order to discover the relative frequency of the different
chords on <em>every</em> account, the results of the two foregoing
operations must be united. Now, as the numbers in the
two columns of Table II. at a medium, are as 3 : 1, and those
in Table III. are in the same ratio, although the factors are to
each other in only the simple ratio of the relative frequency
of the two modes, yet their products will, at a medium, be in
the <em>duplicate</em> ratio of that frequency. Hence, to render the
two sets of results homologous, so that those which correspond
to the same interval may be properly added, to express the
general chance of occurrence for that interval in all the major
and minor keys in which it is found, this duplicate ratio must
be reduced to a simple one, either by dividing the first, or by
multiplying the last series of results, by 3. We will do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
latter, as it will give the ratios in the largest, and, of course,
the most accurate terms. Then adding those results in each
which belong to the same interval, and cutting off the three
right hand figures, (expressing in the nearest small fractions
those results which are under 1000) which will leave a set of
ratios abundantly accurate for every purpose; the numbers
constituting the final solution of the problem will stand as
follows:</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>his work has been for some time before the public, and
it has been more or less the subject of remark in our various
journals. It is, however, so appropriate to the leading objects
of <em>this</em> Journal, that we cannot consider ourselves as
performing labours of supererogation while we consider the
necessity, plan, and execution of the treatise of Professor
Cleaveland.</p>

<p>An extensive cultivation of the physical sciences is peculiar
to an advanced state of society, and evinces, in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
where they flourish, a highly improved state of the arts, and
a great degree of intelligence in the community. To this
state of things we are now fast approximating. The ardent
curiosity regarding these subjects, already enkindled in the
public mind, the very respectable attainments in science
which we have already made, and our rapidly augmenting
means of information in books, instruments, collections, and
teachers, afford ground for the happiest anticipations.</p>

<p>Those sciences which require no means for their investigation
beyond books, teachers, and study&mdash;those which
demand no physical demonstrations, no instruments of research,
no material specimens: we mean those sciences
which relate only to the intellectual and moral character
of man, were early fostered, and, in a good degree, matured
in this country. Hence, in theology, in ethics, in jurisprudence,
and in civil policy, our advances were much earlier,
and more worthy of respect, than in the sciences relating
to material things. In some of these, it is true, we have
made very considerable advances, especially in natural
philosophy and the mathematics, and their applications to the
arts; and this has been true, in some good degree, for very
nearly a century. Natural history has been the most tardy
in its growth, and no branch of it was, till within a few years,
involved in such darkness as mineralogy. Notwithstanding
the laudable efforts of a few gentlemen to excite some taste
for these subjects, so little had been effected in forming collections,
in kindling curiosity, and diffusing information, that
only fifteen years since, it was a matter of extreme difficulty
to obtain, <em>among ourselves</em>, even <em>the names</em> of the most common
stones and minerals; and one might inquire earnestly, and
long, before he could find any one to identify even <em>quartz</em>,
<em>feldspar</em>, or <em>hornblende</em>, among the simple minerals; or <em>granite</em>,
<em>porphyry</em>, or <em>trap</em>, among the rocks. <em>We speak from
experience</em>, and well remember with what impatient, but almost
despairing curiosity, we eyed the bleak, naked ridges, which
impended over the valleys and plains that were the scenes of
our youthful excursions. In vain did we doubt whether the
glittering spangles of mica, and the still more alluring brilliancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of pyrites, gave assurance of the existence of the precious
metals in those substances; or whether the cutting of glass by
the garnet, and by quartz, proved that these minerals were the
diamond; but if they were not precious metals, and if they
were not diamonds, we in vain inquired of our companions,
and even of our teachers, what they were.</p>

<p>We do not forget that Dr. Adam Seybert, in Philadelphia;
Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, in New-York; and Dr. Benjamin
Waterhouse, in Harvard University, began at an earlier
period to enlighten the public on this subject; they began
to form collections; Harvard received a select cabinet from
France and England; and Mr. Smith, of Philadelphia, (although,
returning from Europe fraught with scientific acquisitions,
he perished tragically near his native shores,) left his collection
to enrich the Museum of the American Philosophical
Society.</p>

<p>Still, however, although individuals were enlightened, no
serious impression was produced on the public mind; a few
lights were indeed held out, but they were lights twinkling in
an almost impervious gloom.</p>

<p>The return of the late Benjamin D. Perkins, and of the late
Dr. A. Bruce, from Europe, in 1802 and 3, with their collections,
then the most complete and beautiful that this country
had ever seen; the return of Colonel Gibbs, in 1805, with his
extensive and magnificent cabinet; his consequent excursions
and researches into our mineralogy; the commencement,
about this time, of courses of lectures on mineralogy, in several
of our colleges, and of collections by them and by many individuals;
the return of Mr. Maclure, in 1807; his Herculean
labour in surveying the United States geologically, by personal
examination; and the institution of the American Journal
of Mineralogy, by Dr. Bruce, in 1810;&mdash;these are among
the most prominent events, which, in the course of a few
years, have totally changed the face of this science in the
United States.</p>

<p>During the last ten years, it has been cultivated with great
ardour, and with great success: many interesting discoveries
in American mineralogy have been made; and this science,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with its sister science, Geology, is fast arresting the public
attention. In such a state of things, books relating to mineralogy
would of course be eagerly sought for.</p>

<p>No work, anterior to Kirwan, could be consulted by the
student with much advantage, on account of the wonderful
progress, which, within forty or fifty years, has been made in
mineralogy. Even Kirwan, who performed a most important
service to the science, was become, in some considerable degree,
imperfect and obsolete; the German treatises, the fruitful
fountains from which the science had flowed over Europe,
were not translated; neither were those of the French; and
this was the more to be regretted, because they had mellowed
down the harshness and enriched the sterility of the German
method of description, besides adding many interesting discoveries
of their own. It is true we possessed the truly valuable
treatise of Professor Jameson, the most complete in our
language. But the expense of the work made it unattainable
by most of our students, and the undeviating strictness with
which the highly respectable author has adhered to the German
mode of description, gave it an aspect somewhat repulsive
to the minds of novices, who consulted no other book.
We are, however, well aware of the value of this work, especially
in the improved edition. It must, without doubt, be in
the hands of every one who would be master of the science;
but it is much better adapted to the purposes of proficients
than of beginners.</p>

<p>The mineralogical articles dispersed through Aikin's Dictionary
are exceedingly valuable; but, from the high price of
the work, they are inaccessible to most persons.</p>

<p>The most recent of the French systems, that by Brongniart,
seemed to combine nearly all the requisites that could be desired
in an elementary treatise; and a translation of it would
probably, ere this, have been given to the American public,
had we not been led to expect the work of Professor Cleaveland,
which, it was anticipated, would at least possess one
important advantage over the work of Brongniart, and every
other; it would exhibit, more or less extensively, <em>American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
localities</em>, and give the leading features of our natural mineral
associations.</p>

<p>Thus it appears<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that the work of Professor Cleaveland was
eminently needed; the science, at large, needed it; and to
American mineralogists it was nearly indispensable. It appeared
too at a very opportune moment. Had it come a few years
sooner, it might not have found many readers. Now it is sustained
by the prevailing curiosity, and diffused state of information
regarding mineralogy; and, in turn, no cause could
operate more effectually to cherish this curiosity, and to diffuse
this information still more widely, than this book. Professor
Cleaveland is therefore entitled to our thanks for undertaking
this task; and, in this age of book-making, it is no small
negative praise if an author be acquitted of <em>unnecessarily</em> adding
to the already onerous mass of books.</p>

<p>With respect to the <span class="fs70">PLAN</span> of this work, Professor Cleaveland
has, with good judgment, availed himself of the excellencies
of both the German and French schools.</p>

<p>Mr. Werner, of Fribourg, in some sense not only the
founder of the modern German school of mineralogy, but
almost of the science itself, is entitled to our lasting gratitude
for his system of external characters, first published in 1774.
In this admirable treatise he has combined precision and
copiousness, so that exact ideas are attached to every part of
the descriptive language, and every character is meant to be
defined.</p>

<p>It is intended that a full description of a mineral upon this
plan shall entirely exhaust the subject, and that although
many properties may be found in common among different
minerals, still every picture shall contain <em>peculiar</em> features, not
to be found in any other. It would certainly appear, at first
view, that this method must be perfect, and leave nothing farther
to be desired. It has, however, been found in practice,
that the full descriptions of the Wernerian writers are heavy
and dry; they are redundant also, from the frequent repetition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of similar properties; and from not giving due prominence to
those which are peculiar, and therefore distinctive, they frequently
fail to leave a distinct impression of any thing on the
mind, and thus, in the midst of what is called by the writers of
this school a full <em>oryctognostic picture</em>, a student is sometimes
absolutely bewildered.</p>

<p>Some of the modern French writers, availing themselves of
Mr. Werner's very able delineation of the external characters
of minerals, have selected such as are most important, most
striking, distinctive, and interesting; and drawing a spirited and
bold sketch, have left the minuter parts untouched: such a picture,
although less perfect, often presents a stronger likeness,
and more effectually arrests the attention.</p>

<p>This is the method of description which has been, as we
think, <em>happily</em> adopted, to a great extent by Mr. Cleaveland.</p>

<p>Mr. Werner, availing himself of the similarities in the external
appearance of minerals, has (excepting the metals)
<em>arranged</em> them also upon this plan, without regard to their constitution;
that is, <em>to their real nature</em>, or, at least, making this
wholly subservient to the other: this has caused him, in some
instances, to bring together things which are totally unlike in
their nature, and, in other instances, to separate those which
were entirely similar. Whatever may be said in favour of
such a course, considered as a provisional one, while chemical
analysis was in its infancy, the mind can never rest satisfied
with any arrangement which contradicts the real nature of
things; in a word, the composition of minerals is the only correct
foundation for their classification. This classification has
been adopted by several of the ablest modern French writers.</p>

<p>"It is believed," (says Professor Cleaveland, Preface, p. 7.)
"that the more valuable parts of the two systems may be incorporated,
or, in other words, that the peculiar descriptive
language of the one may, in a certain degree, be united to the
accurate and scientific arrangement of the other.</p>

<p>"This union of descriptive language and scientific arrangement
has been effected with good success, by <span class="smcap">Brongniart</span>, in
his System of Mineralogy&mdash;an elementary work, which seems
better adapted both to interest and instruct, than any which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
has hitherto appeared. The author of this volume has, therefore,
adopted the <em>general</em> plan of Brongniart, the more important
parts of whose work are, of course, incorporated with
this."</p>

<p>A happier model could not, in our opinion, be chosen; and
we conceive that Professor Cleaveland is perfectly consistent,
and perfectly perspicuous, when, adopting the chemical composition
of minerals as the only proper foundation of arrangement,
and, of course, rejecting the principle of Mr. Werner,
which arranges them upon their external properties, he still
adopts his <em>descriptive</em> language as far as it answers his purpose.
For to elect a principle of arrangement, and to classify all the
members of a system so as to give each its appropriate place,
is obviously quite a different thing from describing each member,
after its place in a system is ascertained. In doing the
latter, characters may be drawn from any source which affords
them.</p>

<p>In his "Introduction to the Study of Mineralogy," the author
has given a view at once copious, condensed, and perspicuous,
of all that is necessary to be learned previously to the study
of particular minerals. He begins with definitions and general
principles, which are laid down with clearness.</p>

<p>By way of engaging the attention to the study of this department
of nature, he remarks:</p>

<p>"From a superficial view of minerals in their natural depositories,
at or near the surface of the earth, it would hardly be
expected that they could constitute the object of a distinct
branch of science. Nothing appears farther removed from
the influence of established principles and regular arrangement,
than the mineral kingdom when observed in a cursory
manner. But a closer inspection and more comprehensive view
of the subject will convince us, that this portion of the works
of nature is by no means destitute of the impress of the Deity.
Indications of the same wisdom, power, and benevolence, which
appear in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are also clearly
discernible in the mineral."</p>

<p>"It may also be remarked," continues the author, "that
several arts and manufactures depend on mineralogy for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
existence; and that improvements and discoveries in the latter
cannot fail of extending their beneficial effects to the aforementioned
employments. In fine, the study of mineralogy,
whether it be viewed as tending to increase individual wealth,
to improve and multiply arts and manufactures, and thus promote
the public good; or as affording a pleasant subject for
scientific research, recommends itself to the attention of the
citizen and scholar."</p>

<p>This introductory view of the importance and interest of the
science cannot be charged with the fault of exaggeration, since
it is most evident that neither civilization, refinement in arts,
nor comfort, can exist where the properties of mineral substances
are but imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>As regards this country, the argument admits of much amplification.
The more our mineral treasures are explored,
the more abundantly do they repay the research; and we
trust that the period is not far distant, when we shall no longer
ignorantly tread under our feet minerals of great curiosity and
value, and import from other countries, at a great expense,
what we, in many instances, possess abundantly at home.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>But to return to the plan of the author's work. Few persons,
unacquainted with the science of mineralogy, would suspect
that mere brute matter could exhibit many strong marks,
capable of discrimination.</p>

<p>It may, however, be confidently affirmed, that there is no
mineral which, if carefully studied, may not be distinguished
by characters sufficiently decisive from every other mineral;
an account of these characters ought, therefore, to precede
every system of mineralogy. Professor Cleaveland has, with
entire propriety, included them under the heads of crystallography,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
physical and external characters, and chemical
characters.</p>

<p>He has given a clear view of the Abbé Haüy's curious discoveries
regarding the six primitive figures or solids which
form the bases of all crystals&mdash;the three integrant particles or
molecules which constitute the primitive forms, and of the
theory by which it is shown how the immensely numerous
and diversified secondary or actual forms arise out of these
few elementary figures.</p>

<p>This is certainly one of the most singular and acute discoveries
of our age. It is true, there is a difference of opinion
among mineralogists as to the practical use of crystallography
in the discrimination of minerals. Some dwell upon it with
excessive minuteness, and others seem restless and impatient
of its details. The truth seems to be, that those who understand
it, derive from it (wherever it is applicable) the most
satisfactory aid; and it requires only a moderate knowledge of
geometry to understand its principal outlines. On the other
hand, it is no doubt possible, in most instances, to dispense
with its aid, and to discriminate minerals by their other properties.</p>

<p>Of the external and physical characters of Mr. Werner, Mr.
Cleaveland has given a clear account, combining into the same
view the fine discriminations of the French authors, particularly
regarding refraction, phosphorescence, specific gravity,
electricity, chatoyement, and magnetism. The same may be
said of the chemical characters. We do not know a more
satisfactory and able view of the characters of minerals than
Professor Cleaveland has exhibited.</p>

<p>We would however ask, whether, in enumerating the kinds
of lustre, the term <em>adamantine</em> should not be explained, as it is
not understood by people in general, while the terms denoting
the other kinds are <em>generally</em> intelligible; whether in the enumeration
of imitative forms, <em>lenticular</em> and <em>acicular</em> should not
rather be referred to the laws of crystallization; whether <em>reniform</em>
and <em>mamillary</em> are synonymous; whether <em>sandstone</em>, as
being a mere aggregate of <em>fragments</em>, is a good instance of the
<em>granular</em> fracture; whether in its natural state (at least the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
common ore of nickel) is <em>ever</em> magnetic, till <em>purified</em>, and
whether cobalt is <em>ever</em> magnetic unless <em>impure</em>.</p>

<p>Professor Cleaveland's remarks on <em>fracture</em> are uncommonly
discriminating and instructive, and would lead a learner to a
just comprehension of this important point in the characters
of minerals.</p>

<p>The section relating to the <em>chemical characters</em> is concise,
and professedly proceeds upon the principle of selection. It
might perhaps have been, to some extent, advantageously enlarged;
although, it is true, the author refers us to the particular
minerals for individual instances; still it might have
been well to have illustrated the general principles by a few
well-chosen instances, <em>e. g.</em> how, by the blowpipe, <em>galena</em> is
distinguished from <em>sulphuret of antimony</em>; <em>carbonat of lead</em>
from <em>sulphat of barytes</em>, or <em>carbonat of lime</em>; <em>garnet</em> from <em>titanium</em>;
<em>plaster of Paris</em> from <em>soapstone</em>, &amp;c.; and, among trials
in the moist way, how by nitric acid and ammonia, <em>iron pyrites</em>
is distinguished from <em>copper pyrites</em>; and how, by acids, <em>sulphat
of lime</em> is known from <em>carbonat of lime</em>. As the acids are used
principally for trials on the effervescence of carbonats, most
of which form with sulphuric acid, insoluble compounds, we
should doubt whether sulphuric acid is so advantageously employed
as the nitric or muriatic, in such cases, on account of
the clogging of the effervescence by the thick magena, produced
by a recently precipitated and insoluble sulphat.</p>

<p>According to our experience, the nitric or muriatic acid,
diluted with two or three parts of water, is most eligible.</p>

<p>With respect to the blowpipe: it is <em>a convenience</em> to have a
mouth-piece of wood, or ivory, joined to a tube of metal, as
Mr. Cleaveland recommends; and some authors direct to have
the tube attached to a hollow ball, for the sake of condensing
the moisture of the breath; but every thing which adds to the
expense and complication of the instrument will tend to discourage
its use; we have never found any difficulty in performing
every important experiment with the common goldsmith's brass
blowpipe; and are confident, that, after the learner has acquired
the art, or <em>knack</em>, of propelling a continued stream of
air from his mouth, by means of the muscles of the lips and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
cheeks, while his respiration proceeds without embarrassment
through the nostrils, he will need no other instrument than
the common blowpipe. Indeed it is a truly admirable instrument,
instantly giving us the effect of very powerful furnaces,
the heat being entirely under command, the subject of operation
and all the changes in full view, and the expense and
bulk of the instrument being such that every one may possess
it, and carry it about his person.</p>

<p>The chapter on the principles of arrangement is worthy of
all praise. This difficult subject is here discussed with such
clearness, comprehensiveness, and candour, as prove the author
to be completely master of his subject; and we are persuaded,
that, on this topic, no author can be studied with
more advantage. We forbear to extract, because the whole
should be attentively perused in connexion, and scarcely admits
of abridgement. We entirely agree with Professor
Cleaveland, as we have already said, that the chemical composition
of minerals is the only just foundation of their arrangement;
that next in importance is the crystalline structure, including
a knowledge of the primitive form, and integrant molecule;
and last and least important, <em>in fixing the arrangement</em>,
are the external characters: these last should be only provisionally
employed, where the two first are not ascertained, or
the second is not applicable. When the arrangement is once
made, we <em>may</em>, however, and we commonly <em>shall</em>, in <em>describing</em>
minerals, pursue precisely the reverse order; the external
characters will usually be mentioned first, the crystalline characters
next, and the chemical last of all. In description, the
external characters are often the most valuable; if judiciously
selected and arranged, they will always prove of the most essential
service, and can rarely be entirely dispensed with.</p>

<p>With regard to the <span class="fs70">NOMENCLATURE</span> of minerals, we feelingly
unite with Professor Cleaveland in deploring the oppressive
redundancy of synonymes. Few minerals have only one
name, and usually they have several. With Count Bournon
we agree, that the discoverer of a mineral has the exclusive
right of naming it, and that the name once given should not be
changed without the most cogent reasons. What then shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
we say of the <span class="smcap">Abbé Haüy</span>, of whom, whether we speak of his
genius, his learning, his acuteness, his discoveries, his candour,
and love of truth, or his universally amiable and venerable
character, we can never think without sentiments of the highest
respect and admiration? More than any modern writer
he has added to the list of synonymes, often exchanging a very
good name, derived perhaps from the locality or discoverer of
a mineral, for one professedly significant, but connected with
its subject by a chain of thought so slight, that considerable
knowledge of Greek etymology, and still more explanation, is
necessary to comprehend the connexion; and thus, after all,
it amounts, with respect to most readers, only to the exchange
of one arbitrary name for another. What advantage, for instance,
has <em>grammatite</em>, alluding to a line often obscure, and
still oftener wholly invisible, over the good old name <em>tremolite</em>,
which always reminds us of an interesting locality; how is
<em>pyroxene</em> better than <em>augite</em>, <em>amphibole</em> than <em>hornblende</em>, <em>amphigene</em>
than <em>leucite</em>, or <em>disthene</em> than <em>sappar</em>. Some of the Abbé
Haüy's names are, however, very happily chosen, especially
where new discriminations were to be established, or errors
corrected, or even a redundant crop of synonymes to be superseded
by a better name. <em>Epidote</em> is an instance of the latter,
and the new divisions of the old <em>zeolite family</em> into four
species, <em>mesotype</em>, <em>stilbite</em>, <em>analcime</em>, and <em>chabasie</em>, afford a happy
instance of the former. It were much to be wished, that by
the common consent of mineralogists, one nomenclature should
be universally adopted: for its uniformity is of much more importance
than its nature.</p>

<p>In expressing our approbation of the principles of arrangement
adopted by Professor Cleaveland, we have of course
espoused those of his <span class="fs70">TABULAR VIEW</span>, which is perhaps as nearly
as the state of science will admit, erected upon a chemical
basis, like that of Brongniart, to which it bears a close resemblance.
Some of the subordinate parts, we could have wished
had been arranged in a manner somewhat different. In the
genus lime, it appears to us better to describe the species
carbonat first; because, being very abundant, and its characters
clear, it forms a convenient point of departure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
standard of comparison, in describing the other species
which have lime for their basis, and some of which are comparatively
rare. The same remark we would make upon
quartz, and its concomitant, pure silicious stones. There appears
to us a high advantage in making these minerals clearly
known first, before we proceed to those which are much more
rare, and especially which are much harder, and possess the
characters of gems. For example, if a learner has become
acquainted with quartz, chalcedony, flint, opal, chrysoprase, and
jasper, he will much more easily comprehend the superior
hardness, &amp;c. and different composition of topaz, sapphire,
spinelleruby, chrysoberyl, and zircon, which we should much
prefer to see occupying a later, than the first place in a tabular
arrangement; and, although topaz, by containing fluoric acid,
appears to be in some measure assimilated to saline minerals,
it is in its characters so very diverse from the earthy salts, that
we have fair reason to conclude that the fluoric acid does not
stamp the character; and, as it bears so close a resemblance
to the ruby and sapphire, which evidently derive their principal
characters from the argillaceous earth, we perhaps ought
to infer that this (the topaz,) does so too. Indeed Professor
Cleaveland has sufficiently implied his own opinion, by giving
these minerals a juxtaposition in his table, although the same
reasons which induced the placing of the topaz next to the
earthy salts, could not have justified the placing of the sapphire
there. On these points we are not, however, strenuous; they
are of more importance if the work be used as a text-book for
lectures, than as a private companion. With respect to the
<em>completeness</em> of Professor Cleaveland's tabular view, we have
carefully compared it with the third edition of Jameson's
mineralogy; and although a few new species, or sub-species,
and varieties have been added in this last edition, they are
in general of so little importance, that Professor Cleaveland's
work cannot be considered as materially deficient;
and the few cases in which it is so, are much more than made
up by his entirely new and instructive views of American
mineralogy, to which no parallel is to be found in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
book, and which give it peculiar interest to the American, and
even to the European, reader.</p>

<p>In another edition, (which we cannot doubt will speedily
be called for,) he will of course add whatever is omitted in this,
and we should be gratified to see a good article on the subject
of the ærolites or stones which have fallen from the atmosphere.
This subject is one, in our view, of high interest; and although
<em>in strictness</em> it may not claim a place in a tabular view of minerals,
(we must confess, however, that we see no important obstacle
to its being treated of under the head of native iron,)
there can be no objection to its being placed in an appendix.
The fall of stones from the atmosphere is the most curious and
mysterious fact in natural history.</p>

<p>It may seem perhaps too trivial to remark, that the annexation
of numbers, referring to the pages, would be a serious
addition to the utility of the tabular view. Very few inadvertencies
have been observed&mdash;the following may be mentioned:
<em>Amenia</em>, in the State of New-York, is printed (by a typographical
error we presume) Armenia; and <em>Menechan</em>, where
the menechanite is found, is mentioned as occurring in Scotland,
but it is in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Authors seem agreed that the black-lead ore is an altered
carbonat, but they seem not to have been so well agreed as to
the nature of the blue-lead ore. In the cabinet of Colonel
Gibbs, there are specimens which appear satisfactorily to illustrate
both these subjects. The black-lead is by the blowpipe
alone reducible to metallic lead; there is one specimen in the
cabinet referred to, which is blackened on what appears to
have been the under side, and seemingly by the contact of
sulphuretted hydrogen gas; that which was probably the
upper part remains unaltered, and is beautiful white carbonat
of lead; this appearance is the more striking, because
the piece is large and full of interstices, by which the
gas appears to have passed through. The blue ore is in large
six-sided prisms of a dark blue or almost black colour; where
the prisms are broken across, they present an unequal appearance;
sometimes they are <em>invested</em>; and sometimes slightly,
and at other times deeply, <em>penetrated</em> by sulphuret of lead, hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>ing
the usual brilliant foliated fracture. The part which looks
like sulphuret of lead is easily reducible by the blowpipe, but
not the whole crystal, as authors appear to imply; for if that
part of the crystal which does not present the appearance of
galena is heated by the blowpipe flame, it is not reduced, but
congeals into the garnet dodecahedron, with its colour unaltered:
these crystals are therefore phosphat of lead, and they
appear to be either an original mixture of phosphat and sulphuret
of lead, or the phosphat has somehow in part given
up its phosphoric acid, and assumed in its stead sulphur, perhaps
from the decomposition of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p>Professor Cleaveland will, of course, add new localities, even
foreign ones, where they are interesting, and domestic ones,
where they are well authenticated. Among the former, we
trust he will mention the lake of sulphuric acid contained in the
crater of Mount Idienne, in the Province of Bagnia Vangni, in
the eastern part of Java, and also the river of sulphuric acid
which flows from it and kills animals, scorches vegetation, and
corrodes the stones.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Among American localities, we beg

<p>The introduction to the <span class="smcap">Study of Geology</span>, deserves a
more extended series of remarks than it would now be proper
to make, after so full a consideration of the previous parts of
the work.</p>

<p>Professor Jameson's elaborate exposition of the Wernerian
system, is too full, and too much devoted to a particular system,
for beginners: the sketches of geology contained in the systems
of Chemistry by Murray and Thomson, and in Phillips's mineralogy,
are too limited, although useful: the excellent account
of the Wernerian system, contained in an Appendix to Brochant's
Mineralogy, has, we believe, never been translated;
and we need not say that Professor Playfair's illustrations of the
Huttonian Theory, De Luc's Geology, and Cuvier's Geology,
are not well adapted to the purposes of a beginner; neither is
Delametherie's, nor has it been translated. An introduction to
geology was, therefore, hardly less needed than one to mineralogy.
Professor Cleaveland has performed this difficult duty
with great ability, and has brought this interesting branch of
science fairly within the reach of our students.</p>

<p>Although adhering substantially to the Wernerian arrangement
of rocks, he has, so to speak, blended Werner's three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
classes of primitive, transition, and secondary rocks, into
one class; and where the same rock occurs in all the three
classes, or in two of them, he mentions it in giving the history
of the particular rock. This method simplifies the subject
very much to the apprehensions of a learner. A rigid Wernerian
would probably revolt at it, but the distinctions of Mr.
Werner may still be pointed out, and, we should think, ought
to be, at least by all teachers.</p>

<p>In Mr. Cleaveland's account of the trap rocks, we should
almost imagine that some typographical error had crept into
the following paragraph:</p>

<p>"But in modern geological inquiries, the word trap is usually
employed to designate a <em>simple mineral</em>, composed of hornblende
nearly or quite pure, and also those aggregates in which
<em>hornblende</em> predominates. Hence, the <em>presence</em> of hornblende,
as a predominating ingredient, characterizes those <span class="fs70">MINERALS</span> to
which most geologists apply the name <em>trap</em>."</p>

<p>Now, it is not accordant with our apprehensions that trap is
ever at the present time employed to designate a <em>simple mineral</em>,
nor has Professor Cleaveland himself used it in his tabular
view, or in his description of simple minerals. In our view, it
is the <em>classical</em> word of modern geology, to designate that description
of rocks in which hornblende predominates, and perhaps a
few others of minor importance usually associated with them.
It is true, a rock composed of pure hornblende may be called
trap, but it is not true, <em>vice versa</em>, that this rock, considered in
its character of a simple mineral, is called trap. If our views are
correct, the section which is headed <em>trap</em> or <em>hornblende</em>, should
be <em>trap</em> or <em>hornblende rocks</em>, and greenstone should come in as a
subdivision, and not form a distinct section. With these alterations,
and with the substitution of rock in the <em>first</em>, and rocks
in the <em>second</em> instance, in the paragraph above quoted, instead of
<em>mineral</em> and <em>minerals</em>, we apprehend the view of this family of
rocks would be much more clear, and a degree of confusion,
which learners now experience from the paragraph, would be
prevented. If we are wrong, we are sure Professor Cleaveland
will pardon us; if right, his candour will readily admit the
correction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the manner in which the work of Professor Cleaveland
is executed, the remarks which we already made, have in
a good degree anticipated this head.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, dismiss the subject without adding
that, in our opinion, this work does honour to our country,
and will greatly promote the knowledge of mineralogy and
geology, besides aiding in the great work of disseminating a
taste for science generally. Our views of the plan we have
already detailed. The manner of execution is masterly. Discrimination,
perspicuity, judicious selection of characters and
facts, and a style chaste, manly, and comprehensive, are among
the characteristics of Professor Cleaveland's performance. It
has brought within the reach of the American student the excellencies
of Kirwan, Jameson, Haüy, Brochant, Brongniart,
and Werner; and we are not ashamed to have this work compared
with their productions. In our opinion Professor
Cleaveland's work ought to be introduced into all our schools
of mineralogy, and to be the travelling companion of every
American mineralogist.</p>

<p>We trust that all cultivators of mineralogy and geology in
this country, will willingly aid Professor Cleaveland in enlarging
his list of American localities for a second edition; and
we hope that he will repay them, at a future day, by giving
us a distinct treatise on geology, with as particular a delineation
as possible of the geological relations of the great North
American formations. Mr. Maclure has, with great ability,
sketched the outline; but much labour is still needed in filling
up the detail.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> &nbsp; <em>New Locality of Fluor Spar, or Fluat of Lime
and of Galena, or Sulphuret of Lead.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">M</span>r. Joseph Baldwin, formerly of Connecticut, now
residing near Shawnee Town, in the Illinois Territory, has
given us some interesting specimens of fluor spar. They are
found not far from Shawnee Town, on the banks of the Ohio;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and a few miles below where the Wabash joins the Ohio.
The fluor forms the gangue of a lead vein, and we have pieces
in which the lead and fluor are intimately blended. The lead
ore is the common galena, or sulphuret, with a broad, foliated,
or laminated fracture, and a high degree of metallic splendour.
We reduced it to the metallic state, and it yielded a large product
of very soft lead. On dissolving it in nitric acid, and applying
the muriatic acid till precipitation ceased, the precipitate
formed was <em>all redissolved</em> by boiling water; nor, when
submitted to cupellation did the lead leave any thing upon the
cupel. We, therefore, conclude that it contained no appreciable
quantity of silver. It is said to be very abundant at
Shawnee Town.</p>

<p>The fluor spar is very beautiful. Its colours, chiefly,
very deep purple and violet; but still highly translucent; one
specimen was entirely limpid. Both kinds, when thrown in
coarse powder, on a red-hot shovel, in a dark place, phosphoresced,
and the violet specimens in a very striking manner.
Of the violet kind, we have a specimen nearly as large as a
man's fist, which is perfectly pure and sound, and appears to
have been a single crystal; the natural faces and angles were
unfortunately obliterated by grinding on a common grindstone.
We have others which are decidedly crystals of perfect regularity;
cubes, and passages between the cube and octahedron.
In some of the specimens, the disposition of colours, and the
transmission of light is such as to show very clearly that the
octahedron lies in the centre, as the nucleus or primitive
form.</p>

<p>The size and beauty of the specimens, and the abundance
of this mineral near Shawnee Town, (provided there is no
mistake in the case) clearly entitle this to be considered as the
most interesting American locality of this beautiful mineral.
Measures have been taken to investigate the subject more
fully, and to obtain a supply of specimens.</p>

<p>Quartz crystals appear to abound at the same place, besides
various other minerals.</p>

Amianthus.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> &nbsp; <em>Carbonate of Magnesia, and very uncommon
Amianthus, discovered near New-York.&mdash;Extract of a
Letter from Mr. James Pierce to the Editor.</em></p></div>


<p class="p1 right"><em>New-York, May 18, 1818.</em></p>

<p><span class="small pad1">DEAR SIR,</span><br />

<span class="fs200">I</span> forward you specimens of straw and rose-coloured
amianthus I recently met with on Staten-Island, which I detached,
in strips, from a rock; it not appearing, as is usual, in
veins. It breaks up like flax, and may be spun and wove
without the aid of moisture; and in respect to tenacity, flexibility,
and length of fibre, it may be considered the best found in
this country, and perhaps equal to any hitherto discovered.
Staten-Island exhibits many minerals worthy of examination.
I subjoin, as requested, the following geological description,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Hoboken, where I discovered native carbonate of magnesia,
is situated opposite the city of New-York, on the western or
New-Jersey bank of the Hudson. It is a primitive, insulated
elevation, with a nucleus of serpentine; the ground gradually
descends in every direction except on the river side, where
mural precipices of serpentine rock are observed, extending
about 100 rods parallel with the water, and elevated from 60
to 100 feet above its level. The carbonate of magnesia I found
in horizontal veins of nearly two inches in breadth, and of unknown
depth, in a midway region of this serpentine ledge; I
extracted a considerable quantity with a spoon. When first
taken out it was soft, white, and very slightly adhesive, from
a little moisture; but, when dry, fell to powder without friction.
The nature of the mineral I immediately conjectured,
and treated it with diluted sulphuric acid, in which it entirely
dissolved with effervescence, forming a bitter fluid, and
leaving no sediment. Upon evaporation, well-defined crystals
of Epsom salts were formed. It differs little from the
manufactured carbonate of magnesia of the shops; but is
rather a super than a sub-carbonate. It has been analyzed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Professor Mitchill, who found it exclusively composed of magnesia
and carbonic acid. Carbonates of magnesia, hitherto
discovered, have been, I believe, found impure, and in a state
of rock, requiring chemical process to render them serviceable;
this is, perhaps, fit for immediate use. When I first
mentioned the discovery to mineralogists, they were incredulous,
supposing it did not natively exist in this state, but I convinced
them by uniting it with sulphuric acid.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs80">REMARKS.</p>

<p>The specimen of amianthus, referred to in Mr. Pierce's
communication, is uncommon. The fibres measure from 12
to 15 inches in length, and are as soft and flexible as fine
human hair.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, that in the rocks at Hoboken, Dr.
Bruce discovered the hydrate of magnesia, or magnesia combined
with nothing but water, in the proportion of about 70
per cent. of magnesia. This discovery gave a new and interesting
species to mineralogy; it is now admitted in the systematical
works on mineralogy.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce's discovery is not less interesting; and we presume
he will be deemed correct in the opinion, that pure native
carbonate of magnesia has not been discovered before. The
serpentine of Hoboken, then, is memorable for affording these
two new species.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. V. Native Copper.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> &nbsp; <em>Native Copper.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>n Bruce's Journal, (Vol. I. p. 149.) mention is made of a
remarkable piece of native copper, found near New-Haven
many years ago, and weighing about 90lbs.</p>

<p>We have now to add, (and the fact is, indeed, mentioned
in Cleaveland's Mineralogy,) that another piece has been
recently found half a mile west of the Hartford turnpike
road, opposite the town of Wallingford, and twelve miles
from New-Haven. It was turned up in ploughing to repair a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
road. The country is of the secondary trap formation, and the
rocks, at the particular place, are the old red sandstone of
Werner, which here occupies the plains, and runs under the
trap. The piece weighs almost six pounds; it is fine virgin
copper, with rudiments of large octahedral crystals of native
copper upon its surface, which is more or less incrusted with
green carbonate of copper and ruby oxid, very much resembling
that of Cornwall: the ruby oxid is particularly remarkable
in the cavities of the piece.</p>

<p>As it was found within three or four miles of the place
where the large piece of ninety pounds weight was discovered,
and as copper is known to exist in many places in these hills,
the facts should be kept in view, and may lead to something of
importance.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> &nbsp; <em>Petrified Wood from Antigua.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he mineralogy and geology of the West-India islands has
been, as yet, but little explored. The scientific world has,
however, been favoured with some interesting articles from
the pen of Dr. Nugent; and we are informed that he has described
also the geology of the island of Antigua. We have
recently become acquainted with one interesting production of
this island, and without waiting for Dr. Nugent's account,
(which we believe has not yet reached this country) we shall
lay it before our readers.</p>

<p>We are under obligations to Mr. Pelatiah Perit, of New-York,
for a collection of specimens of silicious petrifactions of
wood from Antigua. Their characters are indubitable; the
distinct ligneous layers corresponding with the annual growth,
the medullary prolongations, the knots formed by branches,
the cracks and the bark, are all distinctly visible. Some of
the pieces are ponderous portions of large trees.</p>

<p>As to the mineralizing matter, it is evidently silicious, and
the specimens are principally the holzstein of Werner; crystals
of quartz are apparent in the cavities; some parts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
agatized, and veins of chalcedony occasionally pervade the
fissures: they are not impressible by steel, and give fire with
it. According to the information of Mr. Perit, they are scattered
over the surface of the Island of Antigua, with a profusion
hardly less than that which Horneman observed of the
same mineral during his travels over the eastern part of the
great African desert.</p>

<p>It is much to be wished that our numerous intelligent navigators
and travelling merchants would, in imitation of this and
of a similar example, mentioned below, bestow some share of
their attention on the natural productions of the countries
which they visit. In this way they might, on their return,
render very essential services to the science of their own
country.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. VII. Porcelain and Porcelain Clays.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> &nbsp; <em>Porcelain and Porcelain Clays.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>hrough the kind offices of a friend, we have been furnished,
from one of the great porcelain manufactories in the
vicinity of Paris, with a series of specimens, to illustrate the
elegant art of fabricating porcelain. The specimens begin
with the raw materials, and exhibit them in all their principal
stages of advancement up to the perfect vessel, including the
materials for the glazing, and the colours for the painting, and
the application of both. At the request of the manufacturer,
through whose liberality we were indulged with this gratification,
we transmitted to Paris various specimens of American
porcelain clays. This gentleman has caused them to be subjected
to trials in the porcelain furnaces, and he finds that some
of them are equal to the French porcelain clays, and some
superior. As our specimens were all labelled with the names
of the places, in this country, from which they were obtained,
we hope soon to learn where to look for porcelain clays, equal
or superior to those celebrated ones from which the superb
French porcelain is manufactured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>As this subject is one of much practical importance to the
rising arts of this country, and as much interest has been
excited in Paris concerning our porcelain clays, we should feel
greatly obliged by the transmission to us of any specimens of
American porcelain clays, with memoranda of the place, the
quantity, the depth at which obtained, the difficulty of obtaining,
and, generally, all the peculiar circumstances. We will
take care that their value shall be ascertained, if they appear
promising, and a proper return shall be made to the proprietor.</p>

<p>To those of our readers who may not be familiar with this
subject, we would however take the liberty to remark, that
porcelain clays generally arise from the decomposition of granite,
and particularly of that kind which is denominated graphic
granite, and which abounds with feldspar. It is, therefore, in
the primitive countries that we are chiefly to expect them&mdash;such
as New-England, and part of the high country of the
middle and southern states.</p>

<p>It should be observed, that if a clay, otherwise apparently
good, burns red, it contains iron, and is unfit for porcelain;
although it may serve well enough for more common and coarse
earthen ware.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>hrough the kindness of Mr. I. Huntington, recently
returned from Java, we have received from that Island some
fine specimens of native sulphur. They are very pure, of
an orange yellow, slightly shaded with white, and occasionally
with red; some of the cavities are lined with delicate crystals.
What gives them particular interest is, that they are believed
to be from that "large, and now nearly extinct, volcano,
about sixty miles from the town of Batavia, at the bottom of
which (of the crater) lie large quantities of native sulphur,
even many hundred tons." It is in the crater of this
volcano that the famous lake of sulphuric acid exists, and from
which it flows down the mountain, and through the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
below, a river of the same acid. (See Tilloch's Phil. Mag.
Vol. XLII. p. 182.) It is a most curious phenomenon, and we
believe entirely without a parallel. Another river, called the
White River, unites with this some miles below its origin: this
river, which is so called from the turbidness of its waters, its
salutary to men and animals; fishes live in it, and vegetation is
nourished by its waters; but after the junction it becomes clear;
the acid dissolving the earthy particles which discoloured it,
and it now becomes fatal to living beings: kills the fish, destroys
the vegetation, and corrodes the stones in its channel. This
remarkable river flows from Mount Idienne, in the province of
Bagnia Vangni, in the eastern part of Java.</p>

the Northwestern part of the State of Virginia, and the
Eastern part of the State of Tennessee.</em> By Mr. <span class="smcap">John H.
Kain</span>, of Tennessee.</p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he most prominent as well as the most beautiful feature
of this country, is that succession of mountain and valley, ridge
and vale, which we meet with in traversing its surface. The
grand range of Alleghany mountains enters Virginia about the
39th degree of north latitude; and, pursuing a southwestern
course, spreads out upon the east end of Tennessee, and terminates
near the southern boundary line of that state, in the
Alabama territory; and about the 34th parallel of north latitude.
In this view are included the Blue Mountains, the
North Mountains, the Allegheny, (properly so called) the
Cumberland, Clinch, Iron, and Smoky mountains, together with
a variety of smaller mountains, spurs, and ridges, all running
parallel to each other, from the northeast to the southwest;
and all, I believe I may say, covered with forests, and presenting
to the eye of the naturalist a most interesting field for
speculation and improvement.</p>

<p>With a few exceptions, the geologist meets with none of
those remarkable appearances which indicate the changes and
convulsions which have been wrought by time, the great
enemy of nature. Occasionally we are presented with a view
of a sublime precipice, formed by a section which a river
appears to have made for itself through an opposing mountain;
and the large masses of ruins, which lie scattered around such
a place, seem, to the imagination of the solitary traveller, the
historical records of commotions, awful even in retrospect.
Most commonly, however, the mountains seem to have lain for
ages in undisturbed repose; and the streams of water, when
they have crossed them, have sought an easy passage through
the ravines, which do not so often divide a mountain, or ridge,
at right angles, as wind between the ends of two opposing
spurs, which pass each other, gradually declining into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
champaign country at their mutual base. Through this whole
extent of country we rarely meet with any remarkable falls
of water; the obvious reason of which is, that the rocks are
so soft that they are easily worn down to the level of the beds
of rivers. But shoals, or shallows, are frequent, and are
formed by beds of rounded sandstone, spread out into a broad
base, over which the water often rushes with no small violence
and noise.</p>

<p>The mountains are generally, though not always, sterile,
and produce nothing but forest trees; but the valleys are,
with hardly an exception, rich, and productive of every variety
of "grass and herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree yielding
fruit." Nor are they less favoured in the mineral kingdom;
possessing the greatest abundance of all the most useful and
necessary minerals, of which we shall now proceed to speak
in order.</p>

<p>All the country included under the boundaries mentioned
above, with the exception of some primitive ranges of mountains
on the southeastern side, is apparently <em>transition</em>. This,
it will be seen by a reference to Mr. Maclure's excellent map,
will extend the boundary of his transition class considerably
farther northwest, and make it include Cumberland Mountain
and all East Tennessee. This would be evident from comparing
the northwestern part of Virginia, which Mr. Maclure
has included in his transition tract with all East Tennessee.
Every mineralogist must observe the identity of the minerals
of the two countries as well as that of their stratification and
general formation. The limestone in the valleys, and the
sandstone on the mountains, lie in strata which make an angle
of from 25 to 45 degrees with the horizon. The limestone
bears the impressions of shells, but rarely, if ever, of vegetables,
and contains beds of hornstone, but not of flint, or what
can properly be called flint.</p>

<p>The rock which lies in the lowest valleys, and often rises
into pretty high hills, and is seen forming bluffs on the banks
of the rivers, is <em>limestone</em>: it is of a dark blue, approaching to
a gray, as it is exposed to the air, and often appearing quite
white. Its fracture is compact in one direction; in another it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is more or less slaty in its structure. It is interspersed with
veins of the crystallized carbonate of lime, more or less perfect,
and of a pure but opaque white. Another variety of this
limestone, not so abundant, is that which is white and red,
having the white and red spots intimately mingled. Its structure
is similar to the other kind.</p>

<p>Lying in beds of this limestone, parallel to, and imbedded in,
its strata, is a stone, which, from its globular form, its hardness,
and its colour, has been usually mistaken for flint. On comparing
it with the flint of chalk-beds, we find it much less translucent,
its colour darker, and its hues duller; and its rough
and irregular fracture, compared with the easy, smooth, and
conchoidal cleavage of the true flint, decides it to be hornstone.
It is found also forming considerable distinct beds on
the hills; and is seen in detached pieces, and irregular pebbles,
covering many of the ridges.</p>

<p>Alternating with the beds of limestone, and possessing the
same formation, is a soft <em>clay slate</em>. <em>Soapstone</em> is found in it.</p>

<p>As soon as we ascend the mountains, we meet with a slaty
sand-stone of various compactness, as it possesses more or less
iron, often forming an excellent iron ore. A variety of this
iron ore has been lately turned to a good use, in the manufacture
of a red paint, near Knoxville, Tennessee. Different
varieties of this sandstone possess different qualities. It is
converted by the inhabitants into millstones, grindstones, and
whetstones. Interspersed among the sandstone of the mountains
we often find very beautiful and interesting specimens of
hornstones, assuming a resemblance to all the silicious
stones, from the chalcedony to the jasper. In this extensive
range of mountains, many other minerals exist, of which we
shall treat more particularly hereafter. The limestone, slate,
and sandstone, as far as the writer's knowledge extends, so to
speak, <em>form the country</em>; the limestone and clay slate dipping
under the sandstone. Gypsum, coal, sulphate of barytes, &amp;c.
are found in these, and we shall now speak of their localities.</p>

<p><em>Gypsum.</em>&mdash;This valuable mineral production exists in Washington
County, Virginia, 20 miles north of Abingdon, in the
vicinity of Saltville. It is similar, in every respect, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
plaster of Nova Scotia, and devoted by the farmers of that
part of Virginia, and Tennessee, to similar purposes.</p>

<p><em>Coal</em> is said to exist in immense quantities in the Cumberland
Mountain. A bed of it is wrought near Knoxville, Tennessee.
It is of an excellent quality; but wood is so abundant
that it is used only in forges.</p>

<p><em>Sulphate of Barytes.</em>&mdash;This mineral is found in Bottetourt
County, Virginia, near Fincastle; and in Sevier County,
Tennessee.</p>

<p><em>Hard Carbonates of Lime.</em>&mdash;Stalactitical concretions abound
in all the caves so often described as existing in this country.
Those of Virginia are more perfectly crystallized than those
of Tennessee. Under the head of <em>hard carbonates</em> should be
mentioned an extensive bed or vein in Montgomery County
in the State of Virginia, near the seat of Colonel Hancock.
It appears to have been formed in a chasm, in the common
limestone of the country, by a calcareous deposition which
resembles, exactly, in all its characters, the calcareous concretions
which are found forming in the caves of the country.
The whole bed may, in fact, be regarded as a cave which has
been filled up in the progress of time, by this curious process.
Its width is various, from two feet to ten, or more, extending
along the side of a very steep ridge, for at least 50 yards, and
it is said to be continued seven miles farther.</p>

<p><em>The silicious carbonate of lime</em> may be worth distinguishing
from the common limestone. It is found in a bed near Colonel
Hancock's, and was supposed to be gypsum. It phosphoresces
beautifully; it is white, and confusedly crystalline in its structure,
and much harder than the common limestone. Indeed
the limestone generally, on the east of the Alleghany, is somewhat
harder than that on the west.</p>

<p><em>Lead.</em>&mdash;There are several localities of this mineral. A mine
of it is wrought near New River, 15 miles from Wythe, Virginia.
Another locality of the ore of lead is said to have been
discovered in Granger County, Tennessee, on land belonging
to General Cocke. It exists also, very near the surface, on
the plantation of the Rev. Mr. Craighead, near Nashville;
which, however, is out of our boundary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Other metallic ores are said to have been found among these
mountains, and particularly those of gold and silver; but the
accounts are vague and uncertain, and not to be credited.</p>

<p>The numerous <em>Caves</em> of this country present attractions
to every, the least curious, traveller; and, in an eminent degree,
to the mineralogist. They are crevices, or large
chasms, probably worn in the rocks by the passage of water.
This will, at first view, perhaps appear a bold assertion; but
if it be recollected that they occur only in limestone, which is
a soft rock, and (under certain circumstances,) soluble in
water; that the rocks bear every mark of having been worn
by water; and that streams of water are always found in
them, it will not appear an improbable hypothesis. It is by
no means difficult to believe that a stream, after having worn
such a chasm as a cave presents, in the solid rock, may have
found another channel; and, forsaking the old, have left
room for nature to display some of her most beautiful works.
A description of one of these caves will be a description of
all; and we shall select <em>Wier's Cave</em>, in Rockingham County,
Virginia, as it is the most curious of any with which we are
acquainted.</p>

<p>The entrance of the cave is narrow and difficult. When
the cave was first discovered, the passage into it was impeded
by stalactites, which had formed perpendicular columns across
it; but these are now removed. As we advance, our course
is at first horizontal, but we soon descend fifteen or twenty feet
by a ladder, and find ourselves in a large echoing cavern. Stalactites
of a silvery whiteness are suspended from above, and
pillars of stalagmites are rising around us. Ledges of rocks
form our floor, and the uneven walls are incrusted over with
a beautiful brown spar, which is sometimes suspended from
the canopy in thin, shining, and translucent sheets. In passing
on over the rugged rock of our pathway, our attention is divided
between a care for our safety, and an admiration of the
surrounding wonders.</p>

<p>Proceeding on through a narrower crevice in the rocks, we
are soon introduced into other apartments, differing in shape
and size from the first, but resembling it in the irregularity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
its walls, floor, and covering, and in the calcareous incrustations
and concretions, which, assuming a thousand fantastic
shapes, and displaying a sparkling lustre, the more vivid as the
light is stronger, give to this whole grotto the power of charming
every beholder.</p>

<p>The cave is a mile and a half in extent, and extremely irregular
in its course and shape. Its perpendicular height varies
from three to forty feet, and its breadth from two to thirty. Its
dividing branches are numerous, forming a great variety of
apartments. The blue limestone appears frequently enough
to satisfy us that it is the groundwork of the whole; but it is
almost every where covered with incrustations of the hard
carbonates. These hang from the arched vault above in clusters,
and often reach the ground, forming massive columns.
Stalagmites again rise from the floor like so many statues; the
irregular sides of the ledges of rocks are often incrusted over
with white crystals of the carbonate of lime, and have the appearance
of banks of salt: at times we seem to walk on diamond
pavements; again our footway is of rounded pebbles,
and seems the bed of a river which had deserted its channel.
Often we pass small streams of water; and the water is continually
dripping from the ends of the stalactites, the echoing
sound of which, when it drops, forms the only interruption to
the profound silence which reigns throughout the cavern.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the diversified shapes which these concretions
assume in the progress of their formation, (and they
are constantly forming,) would be impossible. Suffice it to
say, that there is scarcely any thing on earth to which they
may not be supposed to form a resemblance; and yet, in fact,
they are unlike any thing but themselves.</p>

<p>It is generally known that the earth in these caves contains
the nitrates of lime, and potash, and other salts. The numerous
caves which have been found in the Cumberland mountains
and other parts of Tennessee, have been very productive
of the nitrate of potash. In the investigation of the causes
which have given origin to these salts, it may be recollected,
that wild animals burrow in these caves; that when pursued
by the hunter, they make them the places of their retreat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
probably die there; that the aborigines have made them a place
of burial; and that the streams of water which flow through
them in wet weather, carry with them not only great quantities
of leaves but many other vegetable productions.</p>

<p>The <em>natural bridge</em> is celebrated as one of the greatest curiosities
of the world. Viewed by a geologist, it would probably
be considered as a cave (so to speak) <em>unroofed</em> in all but
one place. It seems improbable that if the ravine had been
made by a convulsion, which had split and separated the rock
to the distance of fifty or sixty feet, any part of it, and particularly
so large a mass as that which forms the bridge, should
have been left, without exhibiting any marks of violence. The
rock is limestone. It is known that this rock wears away
rapidly under the attrition of water; and the supposition does
not appear improbable, that, in the lapse of ages, so large a
creek as that which flows below the bridge, may have worn as
deep a ravine as that which now strikes us with so much surprise,
In short, may not a cave have been originally formed
where the ravine is now, and the pending portion of it have
fallen in at every place except that which now forms this celebrated
natural curiosity?</p>

<p><em>Mineral Springs.</em>&mdash;The mineral springs of this region are
numerous and diversified. Chalybeate springs are promiscuously
scattered over the whole of it; and springs impregnated
with sulphuretted hydrogen are quite common. Salt springs
and licks are found more in the western than the eastern range
of mountains. That which was first wrought by William King,
is well known. The salt here is associated with gypsum. In
the same range of mountains, farther to the southwest, there
are now several other salt-works, and also one to the west, on
Goose Creek, in Kentucky, which has been very productive.</p>

<p><em>The Warm Springs.</em>&mdash;These springs are situated in a country
which presents many attractions to the travelling geologist;
and much light, it is hoped, will yet be thrown on the geology
of our country, by a more minute and accurate examination of
it than has yet been made.</p>

<p>The warm springs ooze through the sand on the south bank
of the French Broad river, in the mountains which divide the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
state of Tennessee from her parent state, about the 36th
parallel of latitude. The temperature of the water is about
95° of Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the river from the springs is a geological
curiosity. A limestone rock is seen dipping under the
sandstone which forms the country. Limestone is nowhere
else to be seen within six miles of this place. In this limestone
rock is a cave similar to others already described.</p>

<p><em>Paint Rock</em>, in the vicinity of the Warm Springs, is interesting
on many accounts. It is a bold precipice on the bank of
French Broad river. At this place the river passes with a
very rapid current directly across the course of a mountain,
which terminates abruptly, and forms the precipice on the
north bank of the river. On looking at the rock, the opposite
end of the mountain, and the ruins around it, the mind is insensibly
carried back to the contemplation of some dreadful
commotion in nature, which probably shook these mountains
to their bases.</p>

<p>The rock is composed of a <em>clay slate</em>; and it is here again
remarkable, that this stone is not to be seen in any other place
within some miles. It has received its name from some red
paintings, (probably left on it by the Indians,) which have the
appearance of hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>To conclude. It will be seen from the above observations,
that this country presents a vast field of most interesting research,
and claims the attention of every traveller who is interested
at all in geological inquiries. If what has been said
will at all contribute to the enlargement of the general stock
of our knowledge on these subjects, the writer will be much
gratified; and it is his sincere wish, that the accuracy of his
remarks may be tried, and his mistakes corrected, by the researches
of succeeding travellers.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XI.</span> &nbsp; <em>Notice of Professor Mitchill's Edition of
Cuvier's Essay on the Theory of the Earth.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he American scientific public are under obligations to
Professor Mitchill for bringing this book within their reach.
It is one of the most eloquent, impressive, and instructive
works on this grand but obscure subject, with which the world
has ever been favoured. The reader is no sooner drawn
within the current of Cuvier's eloquence, than he is borne
along almost without the power or wish to escape. It is believed
there are few intelligent and enlightened persons, whether
geologists or not, who would fail to be gratified by a book
which secures the understanding by a strict course of reasoning
from facts, and delights the taste by a style bold, terse, and
lucid, but at the same time rich and flowing.</p>

<p>The analysis of this work has been ably performed in Europe,
and there is, therefore, the less necessity to attempt it
here. While we take the liberty thus to recommend it, we do
not hold ourselves strictly bound to the admission of <em>every one</em>
of Cuvier's doctrines; and might, perhaps, wish that in a few
instances he had been somewhat more explicit, or somewhat
more qualified.</p>

<p>The additions by Professor Jameson, of Edinburgh, are
valuable and interesting, and are retained in the present
edition.</p>

<p>Those by Professor Mitchill will be perused with pleasure
and advantage. The learned author has assembled, in one
view, a great mass of facts, partly resulting from his own
journeys and observations, and partly deduced from other
respectable sources. We have no doubt that most of these
facts will be considered by the scientific world as very interesting,
whatever views they may entertain of the conclusions
built upon them. The author has occupied himself principally
upon those portions of the United States, which, by the organized
remains both of animals and vegetables, with which they
more or less abound, exhibit the most decisive and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
evidence of changes and catastrophes, whose history is to be
sought in the memorials entombed in the strata themselves.</p>

<p>We give no opinion regarding the theories of Professor
Mitchill, not intending to review the work, but merely to aid,
as far as in our power, in drawing the public attention to the
interesting subjects about which it is occupied.</p>

<p>If we have any remark to add, it is, that an adherence to
the technical precision with which most rocks are at the present
day described, appears desirable in mineralogical and geological
descriptions. When in the valuable additions before
us we read of schorl rock, we gain only the idea of a rock containing
that mineral; but as it occurs occasionally in several of
the primitive rocks, we are at a loss which is intended; we
believe it never forms a rock by itself. So with the slate
rocks: there are several varieties of them&mdash;mica slate, clay
slate, greenstone slate, &amp;c. besides some subdivisions; and the
mere word slate does not always give us the precise idea.
But we are aware that, in the present case, it was less in view
to go into all the details of geological description, than to give
a view of our organized remains and of their supposed origin.</p>

Northern States, together with a Transverse Section of the
Catskill Mountain to the Atlantic.</em></p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he extensive collection of facts in this little book of fifty-four
pages, is creditable to the author's industry and discernment:
he informs us that he has travelled 1000 miles on foot,
while investigating the geology of the district concerning which
he has written. This district is certainly interesting, and
every attempt to diffuse correct information concerning it,
deserves encouragement. Mr. Eaton's account of the regions
he has explored, has every mark of verisimilitude; and we
commend his efforts to diffuse geological information, by short
courses of lectures, in different towns. In his arrangement of
rocks, he has deviated from Werner&mdash;has adopted some views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of Bakewell, and some of his own. Werner's arrangement of
rocks has, undoubtedly, its imperfections and its redundancies;
and yet it may be questioned how far his system has been
really improved by its different emendators. If Werner, by
mentioning argillaceous schistus only in the primitive class of
rocks, left us to dispose of it where we might, when we find it
at one time, covering or sustaining anthracite, with impressions
of ferns, and at another with impressions of fish and vegetables,
and in contact with bituminous coal; still those who, with
Mr. Eaton, throw argillaceous slate into the transition class, and
omit it in the primitive and secondary, embarrass us with an
equal difficulty; for we find argillaceous slate in contact, and
alternating with, mica slate, and without any impressions of
organized bodies, when we must, without a doubt, call it primitive.</p>

<p>This is the fact with the clay slate of the Woodbridge hills,
near New-Haven, which is primitive; that of Rhode-Island,
with anthracite, is transition; and that at Middlefields, west of
Middletown, with impressions of fish, is secondary. Slate then
appears to belong to all these three great classes of rocks.</p>

<p>As to the <em>metalliferous</em> limestone, we do not so much object
to the introduction of this term by Bakewell, although it appears
to us quite as well to say that certain limestones, those
of the transition class for example, are metalliferous. But is
Eaton correct in referring such limestone as that of which the
New-York City-Hall is built, to a metalliferous class? Is not
that limestone decidedly primitive? The fact mentioned of
its containing pyrites, hardly proves it to be metalliferous;
since most rocks contain more or less of pyrites. Some other
remarks of less importance we might add, but we prefer concluding
by recommending this tract to the perusal of those who
wish for information respecting the geological structure of
New-England; and we think that Mr. Eaton is seriously
aiding the progress of geology in the interior of New-England.</p>

Remains.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>his distinguished mineralogist, so advantageously known
by his excellent work on mineralogy&mdash;his researches in company
with Cuvier, into the subterranean geography of the
environs of Paris, and his superintendence of the great porcelain
manufactory at Sevres, is attempting to form an extensive
collection of organized remains.</p>

<p>Through Professor Cleaveland, we have received from him
the following</p>


<p class="p2 center">NOTICE</p>

<p class="negin1"><em>Concerning the method of collecting, labelling, and transmitting
specimens of fossil organized bodies, and of the accompanying
rocks, solicited by</em> <span class="smcap">M. Brongniart</span>.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>The study of fossil organized bodies appears to be of the
utmost importance in determining the relations of different
formations, one of the principal objects of geology.</p>

<p>In order more effectually to appreciate the value of this
method of investigation, it is necessary to multiply observations&mdash;to
endeavour to render them exact and precise&mdash;and
especially to make them upon a general plan.</p>

<p>M. Brongniart has been long occupied in such researches.
The essay published by M. Cuvier and him, upon the geology
of the environs of Paris, has afforded an example of their use.</p>

<p>He has laboured since this period to apply this method to
other formations, which contain the relics of organized bodies;
but he stands in need of much assistance, and he presumes to
ask it, not only of naturalists, but even of all persons interested
in the sciences. By means of the following instructions, he
endeavours to avail himself of the kindness of persons the least
conversant in the discrimination of fossils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>1. To collect all the fossil organized bodies which can be
obtained; especially <em>the distinguishable impressions and remains
of vegetables</em> from coal countries, and beds of wood, coal, and
others. The <em>shells</em>, <em>crustaceæ</em>, <em>madrepores</em>, <em>fishes</em>, &amp;c. It is
not necessary that these bodies should be either large or entire,
but they must be sufficiently characterized to be capable of
being recognized.</p>

<p>It is useless to transmit large unmeaning pieces, which are
recommended only by their size&mdash;such as large ammonites&mdash;large
madrepores&mdash;large pieces of petrified wood&mdash;fragments
of the one, or small individuals of the other, are often sufficient.
We may avoid also collecting the inner moulds ("<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des moules
interieurs</span>") of shells, because they are almost invariably
incapable of being recognized.</p>

<p>2. Petrifactions, isolated and detached from their rock, are
the most convenient in the determination of species; but when
they cannot be separated from the rock, we need not hesitate
to send them engaged; it is sufficient if a portion large enough
for discrimination is visible.</p>

<p>Among shells, those are preferable which have the mouth
or hinge in view; among madrepores, those on whose surface
the figures (les étoiles) are distinguishable; among vegetables,
those whose leaves are distinctly expanded, (expalmées.)</p>

<p>3. Upon the objects transmitted it is desirable to have, at
least in part, the following notices:</p>

<p>1. The exact place from which the object comes: this is
the most important circumstance, and the easiest to obtain.</p>

<p>2. The kind of formation in which it is found, and a specimen
of the stratum, or at least of the rock, which contained it.
It is desirable that this rock exhibit remains of petrifactions
similar to those found in the stratum from which it has been
drawn.</p>

<p>3. The nature of the formation of which this stratum or
rock composes a part, and specimens of as many of the superior
and inferior strata as can be obtained, designating the
order of superposition of the strata.</p>

<p>4. It is important to designate, by the same mark, all the
petrifactions <em>unquestionably</em> found in the same stratum, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
least in the same formation. The specimens ought to be almost
square&mdash;about three inches or more on a side, and one and a
half thick.</p>

<p>5. It is equally important not to mix petrifactions found in
different formations, or in different strata of the same formation;
or if they are packed together, to distinguish them by
numbers, marks, or labels.</p>

<p>When the preceding notices cannot be obtained, the first
will suffice.</p>

<p>In order to collect the petrifactions, and to render them
useful, it is not necessary to know them, nor to be perplexed
to find them out; nor to be afraid of sending objects already
known or of little note. A part of the preceding indications,
connected with the most common petrifactions, will always render
them useful. The important point then is, not to mix
those which are found separate, nor to separate those which
are found associated in the same stratum.</p>

<p>This is easily attained, by designating by a common number,
letter, or any sign whatever, one particular formation or stratum,
and by marking with the same sign all the petrifactions
which are evidently found together.</p>

<p>The labels designating the place or the geological situation,
may be placed in the papers which envelope the specimens, or
a number, referring to an explanatory catalogue, may be attached
to each specimen.</p>

<p>As far as possible, it is necessary to stick the labels or numbers
to the pieces, by pasting; and the surest way is, to write
upon the piece itself, 1st, the place where it is found; 2d, the
number by which it is indicated in the historical notes above
requested.</p>

<p>If there is not time to make out as many numbers or labels
as there are pieces, it will be sufficient to unite in one box or
packet all the petrifactions of one particular stratum, and to
designate them by a general label.</p>

<p>It is necessary to pack the shells and other fragile pieces in
separate boxes, and to wrap each piece in a separate paper.</p>

<p>M. Brongniart cannot allow himself to prefer such requests,
except under the express condition, that a memorandum of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the expenses which the transportation and packing of the
specimens may create shall accompany the letter of advice.</p>

modes of conveyance, with a letter of advice, to the following

Ives, Professor of Materia Medica and Botany, in the
Medical Institution of Yale College.</em></p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>his small plant was observed in flower in July, 1816, by
Mr. Horatio N. Fenn (now of Rochester, State of New-York)
in company with Dr. Leavenworth. The plant and the seeds
have been preserved by me, in a flower-pot, from that time to
the present. The plant was taken a few rods south of Mr.
Whitney's gun manufactory, on the margin of the river, where
it was covered by every tide. I have since observed the plant
in great abundance on the margin of the Housatonuck, in
Derby, and in those small streams in East Haven, Branford,
and Guilford, which empty into Long-Island Sound.</p>

<p>A specimen of the limosella (with some specimens of the
tillea) was sent to Z. Collins, Esq. of Philadelphia, who wrote
me that Mr. Nuttall had found the same plant, a few days previous
to the receipt of my letter, and that they had no question
on the subject of the generic character, but that it would probably
prove to be a new species.</p>

<p>In the transactions of the Medico-Physical Society of New-York,
page 440, it is described under the name of limosella
subulata. A description of the plant was published about the
same time, by Mr. Nuttall, in the Journal of the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. (See Vol. I. No. 6. p. 115.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>In the paper written by Mr. Nuttall is the following query:
"Does this plant, with a lateral mode of growth and alternate
leaves, germinate with two cotyledons?" The following
observations were made in answer to this question. In the
winter of 1816-17 this plant was kept in a situation exposed
to severe frost; yet whenever the weather became warm
for two or three days, it became quite green, but for the last
winter there was no appearance of life in the plant. In
March 1818, the vessel in which the limosella had been preserved
for two summers preceding, and in which were a great
quantity of seeds, was exposed in a warm situation to the sun.
There was no appearance of vegetation until the last of March,
when were observed several cylindrical leaves, some of them
evidently arose from bulbs which had formed the last summer,
on account of the dryness of its situation, which frequently
occurs when plants are removed from a moist to a dry
situation. In other instances single cylindrical leaves arose
from the earth, where no bulbs were to be found; these cylindrical
leaves were thought to arise from seeds, which, if it was
a fact, would prove that the plant vegetated with but one
cotyledon. In a short time the vessel was crowded with the
seeds of the limosella raised by the cotyledons. These were
carefully observed, and in every instance, when the coat of
the seed was cast off, two linear cotyledons were observed,
soon a cylindrical leaf arose from the centre of the cotyledons,
and when this leaf had grown to the length of half an
inch, a leaf of a similar kind arose laterally to a line made by
the first leaf and the cotyledons.</p>

<p>From the facts above stated, it is thought to be proved
that the limosella vegetates with two cotyledons. This was
the fact in every instance where the husk of the seeds was
obviously attached to the cotyledons, and in the few instances
where the plants appeared to vegetate with but one cotyledon,
it is probable that it arose from a bulb or some portion of the
old plant, in which life had not been extinguished, during
the past winter, which was made more probable by the fact
that several of the leaves arose obviously from bulbs. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
limosella,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> with its congeners, hence will take its place in the

<p>Professor Bigelow infers, "that the difference of season
between the northern and southern extremities of the country
is not less than two months and a half." "Difference of
longitude does not seem very materially to affect the Floral
Calendar within the United States." It appears, that in the
same year peach-trees were in blossom at Valencia, in Spain,
about the 19th of March; the apple-tree near London, May
8th; the cherry-tree and pear-tree at Geneva, in Switzerland,
April 3d.</p>

<p>We hope that this research will be prosecuted in the manner
it has thus been happily begun. It evidently affords an
excellent criterion of the actual temperature, on a scale more
extensive than it is practicable to obtain from thermometrical
registers.</p>

<p>Floral Calendars kept in various parts of the United States
would afford very interesting information, as to the changes of
climate in particular places; a common topic of popular remarks
but generally with few and inaccurate data.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he importance of observations on the annual progress of
vegetation is obvious, and, as connected with agriculture,
gardening, &amp;c., eminently useful. Comparative observations
acquire a particular degree of interest, when made by skilful
observers, at the same time, but at different places. Dr.
Bigelow, of Boston, issued a circular, proposing that such contemporaneous
observations should be made in the spring of
1817; and I wish that his request may have been attended to,
when the collection of those observations may afford valuable
materials for an American Calendar of Flora. The blossoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of plants is easily watched, but their foliation and budding
ought not to be neglected. Having been prevented, by various
causes, from keeping an exact record of the progress of vegetation
near New-York in 1817, I submit an accurate journal
which I had kept the year before, at Philadelphia, in which I
hope that some interesting facts may be noticed. Dr. Benjamin
Barton has published a sketch of a Calendar of Flora for
Philadelphia, in his Fragments on the Natural History of Pennsylvania;
by comparing it with mine, many material differences
may be traced, which evince a gradual change of temperature,
although the spring of 1816 was remarkably cold and late.
The greater quantity of species observed by me may, besides,
render this journal a sort of vernal Flora of the neighbourhood
of Philadelphia; and many species found by me are not to be
met in the <cite>Flora Philadelphica</cite> of Dr. William Barton.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he regions watered by the Missouri are inhabited by many
animals, as yet unknown to the zoologists, although many have
been noticed by travellers. A species of marten has lately
been presented to the Lyceum of Natural History in New-York,
which was brought from that country, and appears to
belong to a peculiar species, very different from the common
martens of Europe, Asia, and America, although it has, in common
with it, the character of the yellow throat; but the head,
feet, and tail, afford so many peculiar characters, that no doubt
can be entertained of its diversity. I have, therefore, given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to it the name of <i>Mustela vulpina</i>, or Fox Marten, owing to its
head and tail being somewhat similar to that of a fox.</p>

<p><i>Mustela Vulpina.</i> Definition&mdash;Brown, three large yellowish
spots underneath on the throat, breast, and belly; cheeks,
inside of the ears, and a spot on the nape, white; tail tipped
with white one-third of total length; feet blackish, toes white.</p>

<p><em>Description.</em>&mdash;This animal is of a fine shape: its size is
rather above mediocrity, being about half a foot high, and the
total length being twenty-seven inches, whereof nine form the
tail. The general colour of the fur is of a drab brown, and it
is neither coarse nor very fine. The head is elongated,
oblong, about four inches long, shaped like that of a fox; the
snout is narrow; the nose is black, notched, and granulated,
furnished on each side with black whiskers, two inches long:
there are three long black hairs, or <em>vibrissa</em>, above each eye,
and a few shorter ones scattered behind them on the cheeks,
chin, and tip of the lower jaw, which is white: the cheeks are
whitish, and there is a white spot on the nape of the neck:
the ears are large, broad, and white inside. There are three
large, oblong spots, on the throat, breast, and belly; this last
is the largest; that on the breast the smallest. The fore legs
are shorter than the hind ones, and have, behind, three very
long hairs or vibrissa: the feet and toes of all the legs are
covered with long fur; the former have a dark brown or
blackish ring, and the latter are of a dirty white: there are
five long toes to all the feet, of which the inner one is the
shortest; the nails are white, retractible, and shorter than
the fur. The teeth are as in the genus <i>Mustela</i>, and white;
those of the lower jaw are larger and stronger: the grinders
are four on each side; they are broad, trifid, with the middle
lobe sharp and very long: the tusks, or dogteeth, are very
strong, curved, and approximated, leaving a very small place
for the incisores, which are very small, very short, and flat;
the two lateral ones on each side are situated diagonally, the
second behind, and the two middle ones are only half the size
of the others. The tail is bushy, particularly at the top,
where there is a white pencil of long hairs; the brown of the
remainder is darker than on the body.</p>

<p>From the above accurate description, it will appear evident
that this animal is very different from the common marten of
North America. It must be a ferocious little animal, and very
fierce; which is indicated by the strength of the teeth.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. XVIII. Natural History of the Scytalus Cupreus,
or Copper-head Snake.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XVIII.</span> &nbsp; <em>Natural History of the Scytalus Cupreus,
or Copper-head Snake.</em> By <span class="smcap">C. S. Rafinesque</span>.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">A</span>fter the rattlesnake, the copper-head snake is the most
dreaded in the northern states, being the next largest venomous
snake: he is also more common in the cold parts, where
the former is very rare. Strange as it may seem, this conspicuous
and dangerous animal has escaped the notice of naturalists,
and is not found described in Shaw nor Lacepede.
Having seen two of them near Fishkill, in the summer of 1817,
I endeavoured to describe them completely, and investigate
their history. They were both killed in a meadow, and one
of them while sleeping coiled up near a fence; a slight stroke
of a rod was sufficient, as usual with venomous snakes. It
appears that they are killed much easier than the innocent
snakes; these are often seen to revive after an apparent death,
and do not really die until the next sunset; while venomous
snakes do not easily revive, particularly if the head is slightly
bruised.</p>

<p>This snake is known by a variety of names in different parts
of the State of New-York, since he has every where attracted
the attention of the inhabitants: these names are, <em>copper-head</em>,
<em>copper-snake</em>, <em>chunk-head</em>, <em>copper-adder</em>, <em>copper-viper</em>, <em>copper-belly</em>,
<em>pilot-snake</em>, <em>deaf-adder</em>, <em>deaf-snake</em>; and in New-England,
by the names <em>rattlesnake's mate</em> and <em>red adder</em>, &amp;c. They
have all been given in reference to his colour, or to some presumed
peculiarities in his manners, &amp;c. <em>Chunk-head</em> is a vulgar
expression, meaning thick-head or blunt-head. He has
been called sometimes <em>pilot-snake</em>, on a false supposition that
he was the pilot or guide of the rattlesnake; and he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
considered as deaf, because he is easily surprised, and does
not appear to hear the noise of your approach.</p>

<p>It belongs to the genus <i>scytalus</i> of Daudin, &amp;c., which differs
from the <i>Boa</i> of Linnæus, as the genus <i>Vipera</i> does from <i>Coluber</i>,
being provided with fangs. I have given to it the name
of <i>Scytalus Cupreus</i>, which means coppered scytalus. The
following definition of the species may be considered as comparative
and characteristic.</p>

<p><i>Scytalus Cupreus.</i> Tail one-eighth of total length, with 45
caudal plates entirely brown; 150 abdominal plates, the last
very broad; head oval, coppered above, yellow underneath;
scales carinated on the back, which is coppered, with reddish
brown rings cross-shaped; belly variegated of brownish.</p>

<p><em>Description.</em> Total length about three feet; body thicker
than in the innocent snakes. Head large, broad, oval, obtuse,
very distinct from the neck, nearly two inches long, flattened,
coppered brown above, and covered with large, smooth scales;
yellow underneath, as well as the neck, and with rhomboidal
smooth scales. Mouth very large; fangs yellowish white. Back
flattened anteriorly, a little angular in the middle, covered
with small rhomboidal, obtuse, keeled scales; those of the
sides larger and smooth, not keeled; centre of the back of a
brownish copper colour; sides of a bright copper; broad bands
or rings, becoming forked on each side, and assuming nearly
the shape of a St. Andrew's cross; they are of a reddish
brown: there is a round spot opposite to the sinusses, and the
scales of the sides are minutely dotted of brown. The abdominal
plates are 150, beginning under the head; the last,
covering the vent, is very broad, double the other: they are
of a shining, pale copper colour, with two longitudinal and
lateral rows of great, irregular, brown spots, with some light
brownish clouds between them, and each plate is marginated
of whitish. The belly is very flat and broad, about 1¼ inch in
diameter; and the skin may be distended on the sides, when,
the animal is not fed. Tail short, tapering gradually, about
four inches long, cylindrical, brown, without spots, with 45
plates underneath, and having at the end a small, obtuse, horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
claw, of an oblong, compressed, obtuse shape, and carinated
underneath.</p>

<p>This snake has many of the habits of the rattlesnake; he is
very slow in his motions, rather clumsy, owing to his thick
shape and short tail. He retires in winter into caves, hollow
rocks, and trees, where he lies, in a torpid state, from November
to April; several have been found coiled up together, the
head lying over the back: it is in the same situation he sleeps
in the fields. When found in the torpid state, they may be
carried without waking; but might wake in a warm room.
They do not eat during all that time: their food consists of
birds, frogs, mice, and even squirrels, which they catch by
surprise, as they do not climb on trees. They kill their large
prey by breathing a poisonous effluvia, crushing it in their
folds, and they swallow it whole after covering it with their
clammy saliva. They can remain a very long time without a
meal, and one meal is a long time digesting.</p>

<p>They are generally found in meadows, pastures, and the
edge of woods. They creep slovenly through the grass, and
if surprised by the sight of man, they assume an erect and
threatening posture, darting their tongue and swelling their
head; but they do not attack men, unless alarmed and struck.
They are considered more dangerous than the rattlesnake,
because they do not give notice of their vicinity, and lie concealed
in the grass; but they are easily killed, when assuming
the threatening posture, by a slight touch of a cane, spade, or
any other instrument. The effects of their bite is similar to
that of the rattlesnake, and cured in the same way, by the
prompt application of the <i>Aristolochia serpentaria</i>, <i>Polygala
senega</i>, <i>Prenanthes serpentaria</i>, <i>Macrotry serpentaria</i>, &amp;c. and
other plants, bearing in consequence the name of snakeroots.</p>

<p>This snake is found in New-England, New-York, New-Jersey,
Pennsylvania, &amp;c., and perhaps all over the United
States.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XIX.</span> &nbsp; <em>On a Method of Augmenting the Force of
Gunpowder.</em></p>

<p class="p2 pfs80">Extract of a Letter to the Editor, from Colonel <span class="smcap">George Gibbs</span>.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span> employed, the last year, a man in blowing rocks, and
having seen an account of a method of substituting a portion of
quick lime for a part of the gunpowder usually employed, I was
induced to make a number of experiments upon it. I now
send you the results in the certificate of the person employed,
whose statement might be relied on, even if I had not superintended
myself a number of the experiments.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>"<em>Sunswick Farms, Oct. 19, 1817.</em>&mdash;I certify that, having been
employed by Colonel Gibbs in blasting rocks on his farm, I, by
his orders, made use of a composition of one part quick lime
and two parts gunpowder, and uniformly found the same charge
to answer equally well with a like quantity of gunpowder. I
made upwards of fifty blasts in this manner, as well as several
hundreds in the usual way, and can therefore depend upon the
accuracy of this statement. I found, however, that when the
powdered lime was mixed with the gunpowder the day before,
that the effect was diminished. It should be always used the
day it is mixed.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="pad10"><span class="smcap">T. Pomeroy</span>."</span></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>This preparation was made generally in the morning, put in
a bottle and well corked, to prevent the access of the external
air. The rationale of the process was not explained in the
original recommendation, but it soon occurred to me, that it
must be owing to the desiccation of the gunpowder by the
lime.</p>

<p>The attraction of moisture by gunpowder, is known to be
very great: according to Rees's Cyclopedia, upwards of 16
per cent. has been absorbed, and that the removal, simply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
from near the fire to the corner of the room, produces a considerable
change in its weight. I presume, therefore, that
the lime, which in its caustic state has also a great affinity to
water, attracts a portion of it from the powder, and leaves it
in a state of dryness best fitted for inflammation. But if the
lime should remain too long mixed with the powder, it would
probably attack the water of crystallization of the saltpetre,
and, according to Count Rumford's idea, destroy a great part
of the power. If also left exposed, attractions of moisture would
take place from the atmosphere, the gunpowder would remain
surcharged with humidity as before, and the lime would be
only an inert mass.</p>

<p>The examination of this subject led me to consider the increase
of the power of gunpowder in various situations, and of
its use in the field. It is well known that after a few discharges
a cannon becomes heated, and the range is much
greater, as well as the recoil. The charge of powder is therefore
reduced about one quarter, to produce the original effect.
As I have not heard or seen any explanation of this fact I shall
take this opportunity of mentioning, that it appears to arise
from the same cause as the first explained, viz. the desiccation
of the powder. No person will dispute the heat acquired
by a cannon, or even a musket, after repeated discharges; and
this heat must volatilize or destroy a great portion of the moisture
combined with the powder, assist its speedy inflammation,
and perhaps add to its power, by causing a more perfect combustion
of the inflammable parts of the gunpowder. This
would cause a much greater volume of gas to be produced,
and the high temperature would also greatly augment its elasticity;
and it is well known that the effects of gunpowder
depend upon the rapid production and high degree of elasticity
of a great quantity of aeriform fluids or gases.</p>

<p class="p2 pfs80"><em>Extract from a Letter to the Editor.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span> visited, the last year, the mine of magnetic iron at
Succassunny, belonging to Governor Dickerson of New-Jersey.
The mine had not been worked for a year past, and I did not
descend it. The proprietor, a gentleman of distinguished
science, informed me of a singular circumstance attending it,
which was too important to be left unnoticed. The mine is
worked at the depth of 100 feet; direction of the bed, northeast
and southwest; inclination nearly perpendicular. The
ore in the upper part of the bed is magnetic, and has polarity;
but that raised from the bottom has no magnetism at first, but
acquires it after it has been some time exposed to the influence
of the atmosphere. This fact, of which there is no doubt,
struck me as most singular. I could not recollect any similar
observation; and it is only lately that I have found that Werner
had observed, that iron sand, raised from the depth of 100
feet, had no magnetism. See Rees's Cyclopedia, Art. Sand.</p>

<p>I could only account for this circumstance by supposing that
magnetism existed not in the interior of the earth, as was supposed,
but only on the surface, and in such bodies as received
this principle from atmospheric, or celestial influence.</p>

<p>The late discovery of the magnetic influence of the violet
rays of light, by M. Morechini, a notice of which has since
reached us in the journals, connected with the above fact,
leads me to believe that light is the great source of magnetism.
A learned foreigner,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> whose residence in this country has contributed
much to its scientific improvement, has also informed
me that other substances than metallic have been found, by
compression, to be magnetic.</p>

<p>It is well known that the violet ray is the most refrangible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
or has the most attraction to matter. But there are other
rays, which Herschel, who some years since discovered them,
calls invisible rays, which are still more refrangible, are next
beyond the violet, when refracted, and partake of most of its
properties, except that they are invisible. I have not yet
seen any account of the experiments of M. Morechini, other
than the notice in the journal; but I trust I shall soon be able
to determine whether those invisible rays do not possess the
magnetic power as well as the violet; or, perhaps, possess it
exclusively.</p>

<p>As the refraction of the atmosphere in the polar circles, is
at least ten times greater than in the tropics, a greater quantity
of the magnetic rays will there be separated and combined
than elsewhere; and of course arises excess of magnetism.
Hence the direction of magnetic bodies towards the northern
and southern extreme regions. The great absorption and
emission of light in the polar regions, by the ice and snow,
may cause the extraordinary illumination of that country during
the absence of the sun, and the emission of the magnetic rays
with electricity may, perhaps, give us the aurora borealis.</p>

<p>The coincidence of the diurnal variation of the compass with
the solar influence, deserves particular notice, and will have
considerable weight on this subject.</p>

<p>That there are many facts which cannot readily be explained
by the theory of light, I shall not deny; but in the infancy of
this system we may be allowed to hope that future observations
may enable us to remove present difficulties. One thing
must be admitted, that no theory has heretofore been published
relating to magnetism, which has received or seems entitled to
much confidence. In your next number I hope to be able
to furnish you with further remarks on this subject; but, I
have no doubt that philosophy will finally determine that we
owe to the solar ray light, heat, electricity, and magnetism.</p>

<span class="fs200">I</span>f the following account of a method of using tar and steam
as fuel, recently invented by Mr. Samuel Morey, should be
found sufficiently interesting to occupy a place in the Journal
of Science, I am sensible its usefulness will be much extended
through that medium of information.</p>

<p>The inventor, not unskilled in chemistry, and aware of the
attraction of oxygen for carbon, conceived it practicable to
convert the constituents of water into fuel, by means of this
affinity.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the fact, chemically considered, the operation,
in various experiments, promises to afford a convenient
method of applying to use several of the most combustible
substances, not hitherto employed as fuel. By the process
I shall briefly describe, <em>all carbonaceous fluids</em> may be conveniently
burnt, and derive great force from their combination with
the oxygen and hydrogen gases of water or steam, before or
at the moment of ignition.</p>

</div>

<p>A tight vessel, cylindrically shaped, was first employed, containing
rosin, connected with a small boiler by a pipe which
entered near the bottom, and extended nearly its length, having
small apertures, over which were two inverted gutters, inclining
or sloping upwards over each other; the upper one longer
than the other, intended to detain the steam in the rosin, in its
way to the surface. The rosin being heated, <em>carburetted hydrogen
gas</em> would issue from the outlet, or pipe, inserted near the
top of the vessel, and being ignited, afforded a small blaze,
about as large as that of a candle; but, when the steam was
allowed to flow, this blaze would instantly shoot out many hundred
times its former bulk, to the distance of two or three feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>It is presumed the steam was decomposed, and carburetted
hydrogen and carbonic oxide, or carbonic acid, produced as
the steam passed, very near the hot bottom of the vessel.</p>

<p>Another apparatus was constructed, consisting of two vessels,
one within the other, having a cover common to both; the
inner one to contain <em>tar</em>, (as a more convenient substance than
rosin;) the outer vessel to contain water, which surrounds
the other, and lies under its bottom; or, in other words, a
vessel of tar set into a vessel of boiling water. The boiler
has a lining of sheet copper, or tin, to promote the ebullition.
The tar vessel being riveted to the cover, holes are made
through its sides, near to the cover, to allow the steam to pass
in, and act on its surface. The cover being secured on, a safety
valve is provided for the steam vessel, and two cocks; one
over the tar, the other over the water, are fixed contiguously;
the first has a tube, or is elongated to reach nearly to the bottom
of the tar, which ascends, and is driven out by the pressure
of the steam on its surface. Both cocks conduct to a
pipe, wherein is placed a large wire, or metallic rod, which
about fills the tube, and is perforated obliquely, or zig zag, to
increase the length of the passage, and to mingle the tar and
steam more intimately. The gases, or vapours, issue from a
small orifice at the end of the pipe; and, being ignited by a
little fire, into which it is directed, an intense and voluminous
blaze is produced, and continues as long as the materials
remain unexhausted. A hot brick, instead of the fire, answers
the same purpose.</p>

<p>This apparatus contained but about one quart of tar, (which
must always be nicely strained,) and it lasted one and a half
hour, and the flame was sufficient to fill a common fireplace, if
not allowed to escape, by its violence, up the chimney. Its force
will be according to the elasticity of the steam. I regret being
unable, since, to make more exact and varied experiments, to
demonstrate the economy of this fuel. This point, however,
and the chemical facts, will be the subject of a future communication.
And probably a form of a stove may be devised,
wherein it may be used for the purposes of warmth, light, and
cooking; and another apparatus to light streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>But this invention will be of more special use <em>as fuel for
steam engines applied to navigation</em>&mdash;the purpose principally
for which I have purchased the patent right.</p>

<p>This may be the subject of another communication.</p>

Experimental Philosophy and Mineralogy in the South-Carolina

<p class="p2 center"><em>To Professor Silliman.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Dear Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="fs200">I</span>n answer to your inquiry respecting the changes in our wells,
since the memorable period of the earthquakes, I would make
the following observations:</p>

<p>These tremendous convulsions of nature commenced in
December, 1811, and were continued, at intervals, until the
latter end of the succeeding month of March, with different
degrees of violence, in this and some of the adjacent states.
In November, 1812, I visited this town, and then understood
that the wells, which are generally very deep, had an abundance
of water in them. This continued to be the case for
about one year after; and in the College well, in particular,
which was a remarkably fine one, there were always about
twelve feet of water, notwithstanding its daily consumption by
more than two hundred persons. Shortly after this time, many
of the wells in the town began to fail in their usual supply of
water, although they were frequently cleaned out and occasionally
deepened. Their state became worse every year,
until, at length, about three years since, some of them proved
to be entirely dry, and most of the others had their water turbid,
and diminished to the depth of only two or three feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
A little anterior to this period, what were called the dry years
had commenced, and there were, comparatively, very scanty
falls of rain until the last spring; since when there has been a
very large quantity. To elucidate the subject more fully, it
may not be amiss to give some topographical account of the
town of Columbia. About a mile from the eastern bank of the
Cogaree the town begins to be thickly built up, and at this
distance the elevation of ground is supposed to be one hundred
feet above the level of the river in its ordinary state.
The hill is then tolerably level for the space of a mile or more
in its western extent, and its soil is principally composed of a
loose, porous sand, with which few, if any, stones are intermixed
at any depth that has yet been penetrated. In attempting
to account for the failure of the well-waters, it was supposed
by some that the earthquakes had produced such changes
in the loose texture of the soils, that the veins of water which
used to supply the wells, had sunk beneath the level of these
reservoirs; but on this head it is to be observed, that there
was no remarkable failure of water for one or two years after
these changes were supposed to have been effected. Others
again, connecting the greatest failure of water with the concurring
dearth of rain, conceived that the fact might be explained
by the droughts occasioning a deficiency in the river-water,
and thus cutting off the supply which they supposed had
heretofore percolated from the margin of the river into the
wells. If their hypothesis was correct, it was believed that
the difficulty would be removed, either by deepening the wells,
or by subsequent large supplies of rain. Many wells were
immediately deepened from two to eight or ten feet, but the
remedy proved very inadequate. And since the great falls of
rain, within a year past, although there are somewhat larger
supplies of water in some wells, yet there is not the half as
much as existed before the earthquakes. The College well,
although deepened several feet, does not now contain generally
more than four or five feet of water. I must not omit to
remark, that two wells, situated in a longitudinal line from
north to south, with regard to each other, and also in a lower
spot of ground, never failed entirely, although they diminished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
considerably, and now yield more copious supplies than any
others.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the cause of this phenomenon, the effects
are so inconvenient, and it is so generally believed that they
are likely to be permanent, that the inhabitants of the town are
beginning to build cisterns, in order to accumulate artificial
reservoirs of water.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. XXIII. Respiration of Oxygen Gas.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XXIII.</span> &nbsp; <em>Respiration of Oxygen Gas.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>t is not extraordinary, when oxygen gas was first discovered,
and found to be the principle of life to the whole animal creation,
that extravagant expectations should have been formed
as to its medicinal application. Disappointment followed of
course, and naturally led to a neglect of the subject; and, in
fact, for some years, pneumatic medicine has gone into discredit,
and public opinion has vibrated to the extreme of
incredulity. Partaking in a degree in this feeling, we listened
with some reluctance to a very pressing application on this
subject during the last summer. A young lady, apparently in
the last stages of decline, and supposed to be affected with
hydrothorax, was pronounced beyond the reach of ordinary
medical aid. As she was in a remote town in Connecticut,
where no facilities existed towards the attainment of the object,
we felt no confidence that, even if oxygen gas were possessed
of any efficacy in such cases, it would <em>actually</em> be applied
in this case, in such a manner as to do any good. Yielding, however,
to the anxious wishes of friends, we furnished drawings
for such an apparatus as might be presumed attainable, and
also written and minute directions for preparing, trying, and
administering the gas. It was obtained from nitrate of potash,
(saltpetre,) not because it was the best process, but because
the substance could be obtained in the place, and because a
common fire would serve for its extrication. The gas obtained
had, of course, a variable mixture of nitrogen or azot, and
probably on an average, might not be purer than nearly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<em>reversed</em> proportions of the atmosphere&mdash;that is, 70 to 80 per
cent. of oxygen to 20 or 30 nitrogen; and it is worthy of
observation, whether this circumstance might not have influenced
the result.</p>

<p>Contrary to our expectations, the gas (as we are since informed
by good authority) was skilfully prepared and perseveringly
used. From the first, the difficulty of breathing and
other oppressive affections were relieved: the young lady
grew rapidly better, and in a few weeks entirely recovered
her health. A respectable physician, conversant with the
case, states, in a letter now before us, "that the inhaling of
the oxygen gas relieved the difficulty of breathing, increased
the operation of diuretics, <em>and has effected her cure</em>. Whether
her disease was hydrothorax, or an anasarcous affection of the
lungs, is a matter I believe not settled."</p>

<p>Should the revival of the experiments on the respiration of
oxygen gas appear to be desired, it would not be difficult to
simplify the apparatus and operations so as to bring them
within the reach of an intelligent person, even although ignorant
of chemistry: and this task, should there be occasion, we
would cheerfully undertake to perform.</p>

<p>This interesting class of experiments ought to be resumed,
not with the spirit of quackery, or of extravagant expectation,
but with the sobriety of philosophical research; and it is more
than probable that the nitrous oxyde which is now little more
than a subject of merriment and wonder, if properly diluted
and discreetly applied, would be productive of valuable effects.</p>

<p class="center">CONCERNING HEAT.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">"H</span>eat, considered as one of the most important agents,
especially in relation to chemistry, and even to mineralogy,
has also been the subject of numerous labours, both with regard
to the means of augmenting and of diminishing its effects.</p>

<p>"To the former belong the numerous experiments made,
especially in England, with the blowpipe, supplied by a mixture
of oxygen and hydrogen gases. Mr. Clarke has evidently
been more extensively engaged in these researches than any
other person, as our readers have perceived in the extracts
which we have given from the labours of this learned chemist;
but it is proper also to give publicity to the protest
(réclamation) made to us in favour of Mr. Silliman.</p>

<p>"We have already stated that Mr. Hare, of Philadelphia, first
conceived the idea of forming a blowpipe with explosive gas;
but as we have not been conversant with the memoirs of the
Society of Arts and Sciences of Connecticut, we have not made
mention of Mr. Silliman.</p>

<p>"The fact is, that this chemist, Professor at New-Haven, published,
on the 7th of May,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> 1812, a memoir containing the results
of experiments made upon a very great number of bodies, until
that time reputed to be infusible; and, among others, upon
the alkaline earths, the decomposition of which he effected.</p>

<p>"The experiments of Mr. Clarke were therefore subsequent;
but, having been made upon a still more extensive list of substances,
they are scarcely less interesting.</p>

<p>"It results then, from the experiments of Messrs. Hare,
Silliman, Clarke, Murray, and Ridolfi, that there is really no
substance which is infusible in the degree of heat produced
by this kind of blowpipe.</p>

<p>"In this new department of physics, it is attempted not only
to apply the blowpipe to a very great number of bodies, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>so to modify the instrument or apparatus as to give it the
highest degree of convenience, and especially to obviate the
danger of explosion."</p>

<p class="right">pp. 38 &amp; 39.</p>


<p class="pfs70">REMARKS.</p>

<p>As the results produced by Mr. Hare's Compound Blowpipe,
fed by oxygen and hydrogen gases, continue to be mentioned
in Europe, in many of the Journals, without any reference
to the results long since obtained in this country, we republish
the following statement of facts, which was, in substance,
first published in New-York, more than a year since.
It should be observed, that Mr. Tilloch has since published,
in the Philosophical Magazine in London, the memoir which
contained the American results, and there have been some
other allusions to it in different European Journals, and to
Mr. Hare's previous experiments; but still this interesting
class of results continue to be attributed to others than their
original discoverers.</p>

<p class="p1 right"><em>Yale College, April 7, 1817.</em></p>

<p>Various notices, more or less complete, chiefly copied from
English newspapers, are now going the round of the public prints
in this country, stating that "<em>a new kind of fire</em>" has been
discovered in England, or, at least, new and heretofore unparalleled
means of exciting heat, by which the gems, and all the
most refractory substances in nature, are immediately melted,
and even in various instances dissipated in vapour, or decomposed
into their elements. The first glance at these statements,
(which, as regards the effects, I have no doubt are
substantially true,) was sufficient to satisfy me, that the basis
of these discoveries was laid by an American discovery, made
by Mr. Robert Hare of Philadelphia, in 1801. In December
of that year, Mr. Hare communicated to the Chemical Society
of Philadelphia his discovery of a method of burning oxygen
and hydrogen gases in a united stream, so as to produce a very
intense heat.</p>

<p>In 1802, he published a detailed memoir on the subject,
with an engraving of his apparatus, and he recited the effects
of his instrument; some of which, in the degree of heat produced,
surpassed any thing before known.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1802, and 1803, I was occupied with him, in Philadelphia,
in prosecuting similar experiments on a more extended scale;
and a communication on the subject was made to the Philosophical
Society of Philadelphia. The memoir is printed in their
transactions; and Mr. Hare's original memoir was reprinted
in the Annals of Chemistry, in Paris, and in the Philosophical
Magazine, in London.</p>

<p>Mr. Murray, in his System of Chemistry, has mentioned Mr.
Hare's results in the fusion of several of the earths, &amp;c. and
has given him credit for his discovery.</p>

<p>In one instance, while in Europe, in 1806, at a public lecture,
I saw some of them exhibited by a celebrated Professor,
who mentioned Mr. Hare as the reputed author of the invention.</p>

<p>In December, 1811, I instituted an extended course of
experiments with Mr. Hare's blowpipe, in which I melted
lime and magnesia, and a long list of the most refractory
minerals, gems, and others, the greater part of which had
never been melted before, and I supposed that I had decomposed
lime, barytes, strontites, and magnesia, evolving their metallic
basis, which burnt in the air as fast as produced. I communicated
a detailed account of my experiments to the Connecticut
Academy of Arts and Sciences, who published it in
their Transactions for 1812; with their leave it was communicated
to Dr Bruce's Mineralogical Journal, and it was
printed in the 4th number of that work. Hundreds of my
pupils can testify that Mr. Hare's splendid experiments, and
many others performed with his blowpipe, fed by oxygen and
hydrogen gases, have been for years past annually exhibited,
in my public courses of chemistry in Yale College, and that
the fusion and volatilization of platina, and the combustion of
that metal, and of gold and silver, and of many other metals;
that the fusion of the earths, of rock crystal, of gun flint, of
the corundum gems, and many other, very refractory substances;
and the production of light beyond the brightness of
the sun, have been familiar experiments in my laboratory.
I have uniformly given Mr. Hare the full credit of the invention,
although my researches, with his instrument, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
pushed farther than his own, and a good many new results
added.</p>

<p>It is therefore with no small surprise that, in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales
de Chimie et de Physique</span>, for September, 1816, I found a
translation of a very elaborate memoir, from a Scientific
Journal, published at the Royal Institution in London, in
which a full account is given of a very interesting series of
experiments performed by means of Mr. Hare's instrument;
or rather one somewhat differently arranged, but depending
on the same principle. Mr. Hare's invention is slightly mentioned
in a note, but no mention is made of his experiments, or
of mine.</p>

<p>On a comparison of the memoir in question with Mr. Hare's
and with my own, I find that very many of the results are identical,
and all the new ones are derived directly from Mr. Hare's
invention, with the following differences.&mdash;In Mr. Hare's, the
two gases were in distinct reservoirs, to prevent explosion;
they were propelled by the pressure of a column of water,
and were made to mingle, just before their exit, at a common
orifice. In the English apparatus, the gases are both in one
reservoir, and they are propelled by their own elasticity, after
condensation, by a syringe.</p>

<p>Professor Clarke, of Cambridge University, the celebrated
traveller, is the author of the memoir in question; and we
must presume that he was ignorant of what had been done by
Mr. Hare and myself, or he would candidly have adverted to
the facts.</p>

<p>It is proper that the public should know that Mr. Hare was
the author of the invention, by means of which, in Europe,
they are now performing the most brilliant and beautiful
experiments; and that there are very few of these results
hitherto obtained there, by the use of it, (and the publication
of which has there excited great interest,) which were not,
several years ago, anticipated here, either by Mr. Hare or
by myself.</p>

<p>As I have cited only printed documents, or the testimony
of living witnesses, I trust the public will not consider this
communication as indelicate, or arrogant, but simply a mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ter
of justice to the interests of American science, and particularly
to Mr. Hare.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XXV.</span> &nbsp; <em>The Northwest Passage, the North Pole,
and the Greenland Ice.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>n looking over the foreign journals, we find no articles of
intelligence so interesting as those which respect the three
subjects mentioned above. Indeed, as they have found their
way into most of our newspapers, it is now generally known
in this country, that, in consequence of the reported breaking
up of the Greenland ice, an expedition has already left England,
in two divisions, the one for the purpose of exploring a
northwest passage to Asia, around the North American continent,
by the way of Davis's Straits; the other, for effecting the
same object <em>by passing over the north pole</em>.</p>

<p>If Horace thought that man almost impiously daring who first
adventured upon the open sea, what shall we say of the hardihood
of the attempt to visit <span class="fs70">THE POLE</span>?&mdash;the pole, which it is
impossible to contemplate without awe&mdash;which, in all probability,
has never been visited by any living being&mdash;where the
dreary solitude has never been broken by human voice&mdash;where
the sound of war has never been heard, and darkness and cold
exert an almost undisputed dominion! What must be the emotions
of that man who first stands upon the point of the earth's
axis! Who, no longer partaking of the revolution, in circles
of latitude, slowly revolves on the axis of his own body, once
in twenty-four hours&mdash;to whom the sun does not rise or set,
but, moving in a course very oblique to the horizon, makes
scarcely a perceptible progress in twenty-four hours, and at
the end of three months, when he has attained his noon, is only
23° 28′, on the arc of a vertical circle, above the horizon&mdash;to
whom longitude is extinct, and who can move in no possible
direction but south&mdash;to whom the stars are a blank, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
whom the polar star, could he see it, would appear in the zenith.
Such are some of the most obvious results of a position on the
pole. The man who first establishes himself on this sublime
point, will have more reason for self-congratulation than he
who led the Persian myriads into Greece, or he who pushed
the Macedonians to the Indus.</p>

<p>On these interesting subjects, we beg leave to refer our
readers to a very able treatise in the Quarterly Review for
February, 1818, where all the topics at the head of this article
are discussed with much learning and ability.&mdash;We extract the
following passage:</p>

<p>"If an open navigation should be discovered across the
polar basin, the passage over the pole or close to it, will be
one of the most interesting events to science that has ever
occurred. It will be the first time that the problem was practically
solved with which the learners of geography are sometimes
puzzled&mdash;that of going the shortest way between two
places lying east and west, by taking a direction of north and
south. The passage of the pole will require the undivided
attention of the navigator. On approaching this point, from
which the northern coasts of Europe, Asia, and America, and
every part of them, will bear <em>south</em> of him, nothing can possibly
assist him in determining his course, and keeping on the right
meridian of his destined place, but a correct knowledge of the
<em>time</em>: and yet no means of ascertaining that time will be
afforded him. The only <em>time</em> he can have, with any degree
of certainty, as long as he remains on or near the pole, must
be that of Greenwich, and this he can know only from good
chronometers; for, from the general hazy state of the atmosphere,
and particularly about the horizon, and the sameness
in the altitude of the sun at every hour in the four-and-twenty,
he must not expect to obtain an approximation even of the
apparent time, by observation, and he will have no stars to
assist him. All his ideas respecting the heavens and the reckonings
of his time will be reversed, and the change not gradual,
as in proceeding from the east to the west, or the contrary,
but instantaneous. The magnetic needle will point to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
unknown magnetic pole, or fly around from the point of the
bowl in which it is suspended, and that which indicated north
will now be south; the east will become the west, and the
hour of noon will be that of midnight.</p>

<p>"These curious circumstances will probably be considered
to mark the passage by the pole, as the most interesting of the
two, while it will perhaps be found equally easy. We have,
indeed, very little doubt, that if the polar basin should prove
to be free from land about the pole, it will also be free of ice.
A sea of more than two thousand miles in diameter, of unfathomable
depth, (which is the case between Greenland and
Spitzbergen,) and in constant motion, is not likely to be frozen
over at any time. But if all endeavours to discover a passage
to the Pacific by either route should prove unavailing, it will
still be satisfactory to have removed every doubt on this subject
by ascertaining the fact. In making the attempt, many
objects interesting and important to science will present themselves
to the observation of those who are engaged in the two
expeditions. That which proceeds up Davis's Straits, will
have an opportunity of adjusting the geography of the northeast
coast of America, and the west coast of Greenland; and
of ascertaining whether the latter be not an island or an archipelago
of islands; and much curious information may be expected
from both.</p>

<p>"They will ascertain, what is as yet but very imperfectly
known, the depth, the temperature, the saltness, and the specific
gravity of the sea-water in those high latitudes&mdash;the velocity
of the currents, the state of atmospherical electricity in
the arctic regions, and its connexion, at which we have glanced,
with the inclination, declination, and intensity of force of the
magnetic needle; on which subject alone, a collection of facts
towards the upper part of Davis's Straits would be worth a
voyage of discovery. It has, indeed, been long suspected that
one of the magnetic poles will be found in this neighbourhood,
as in no part of the world have such extraordinary phenomena
been observed, or such irregularities in the vibration and the
variation of the needle.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"A comparison of the magnetic influence near the pole,
with what it has been observed to be on the equator, might
lead to important results; and the swinging of a pendulum as
near the pole as can be approached, to compare with the oscillations
observed in the Shetland Islands, and in the southern
hemisphere, would be a great point gained for science."</p>

<p>We have no room in this Number to consider the probability
of success in this attempt, nor the question, whether the breaking
up of the Greenland ice, and its passage to, and dissolution
in, the south, have been attended with a chilling influence on
the continents. That such a chilling effect might be extensively
exerted, is certainly credible. Approaching some of
the icebergs, in April 1805, on the shoals of Newfoundland,
we were rendered very sensible of the vicinity of such dangerous
neighbours, by the great chill in the air, long before
they were visible; and when we had passed them, the weather
again grew milder.</p>

<p>Perhaps it militates against the probability of finding the
northern polar basin free of ice, that Captain Cook, in his
approximation to the southern pole, in January, 1773, when in
latitude 67° 15′ south, "could proceed no farther; the ice
being entirely closed to the south, in the whole extent from
east to west-southwest, without the least appearance of any
opening." The advanced season of the year did not, however,
permit Captain Cook to ascertain whether he could coast
around this ice&mdash;whether it was ultimately attached to land, or
was a part of a vast field extending to the south pole. This last
is however highly improbable, because being found about 23°
from the pole, it is hardly credible that it would occupy so
extensive a region as to embrace the pole, and, perhaps extend
as much farther beyond; especially as in similar latitudes in
the opposite hemisphere, navigation is comparatively free, and
has been pushed even to more than 80° of north latitude.</p>

<p>The scientific, as well as the commercial world, will wait
with no small impatience for the termination of the two grand
arctic expeditions, which are among the most original and
daring, and may be among the most interesting and momentous
hitherto undertaken by man.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I trust the public will pardon me for stating, that various scientific friends,
despairing of the revival of the Journal of Dr. Bruce, had, for some time, pressed
me to undertake the editing of a Journal of Science. Considerations of personal
friendship prevented me from listening to such proposals till the decline of Dr.
Bruce's health, attended by the most alarming symptoms, rendered it very obvious
that his Journal would not be revived. Towards the close of last November, in a
personal interview, I communicated to him the design of the present work, at the
same time offering to waive it, provided he considered it as probable that his own
Journal would be resumed. Of this, however, he gave no encouragement; but,
on the contrary, expressed his warm approbation of my undertaking, authorized
me to consider him as a contributor, and to make public use of his name as a
patron. It was not till after this that the annunciation of this work took place;
and it is certain that had not all hope of the resumption of Dr. Bruce's Journal
been completely cut off, <em>this</em> would not have appeared.</p></div>

when it is considered that this is the value of that interval as sounded by voices
and perfect instruments; when the 3ds which compose it are made perfect. This
interval, as found in the scale which has the fewest tempered concords possible
referred to at the beginning of this essay, ought to be regarded as the true 5th,
flattened by a comma, in the same manner as one of its component 3ds will be
allowed by all to be flattened.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The propriety of this limitation will be manifest, when we consider that in
organ music, the chords are generally played more full, and are more protracted,
than in music for other keyed instruments. It is harmony which constitutes its
character, in a higher degree than in music for other instruments. Hence the
harmony of the organ ought not to be impaired by including in our computations
any music not adapted to it. If a similar examination of music for the piano-forte
would afford a set of results essentially different from those of this proposition, this
is no proof that it ought to have any concern in a system of temperament designed
primarily for the organ, but merely that the same temperament cannot be equally
adapted to different instruments. If, as is probable, such an examination would
give essentially the same results, to introduce them would be superfluous.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> &nbsp; <em>Remarks on the Geology and Mineralogy of a
Section of Massachusetts on Connecticut River, with a
Part of New-Hampshire and Vermont; by</em> <span class="smcap">Edward
Hitchcock</span>, A. M. <em>Principal of Deerfield Academy</em>.</p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he geology of this tract, from a few miles south of Northampton
in Massachusetts, to the north boundary of Brattleborough
in Vermont, and of Chesterfield in New-Hampshire,
is shown on the subjoined map. The primitive formation,
except the argillite, is coloured vermilion; the secondary,
blue; and the alluvial, gamboge yellow, according to Cleaveland.
The alluvial part is elevated above the bed of Connecticut
river from 10 to 100 feet, and, in most places, reposes
on red sandstone. The soil in the northern part is generally
argillaceous; but in the southern more siliceous. The secondary
formation consists chiefly of detached eminences that
rise abruptly from the plain, and are composed of red sandstone
and puddingstone alternating, except the elevations A
and B, (Holyoke and Tom) and a part of the range CD, passing
through Deerfield and Greenfield, which are greenstone.
The part coloured rose-red consists of argillite, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
alternating with mica slate, siliceous slate, or chlorite slate.
It is thus coloured to show the extent of the argillite, and not
from a belief that this rock is of the transition class; for in
this region the argillite is undoubtedly primitive. Some quarries
of this rock have been opened in Massachusetts; and in
Vermont are extensively wrought. I have not learnt how far
the argillite extends northward in Vermont and New-Hampshire.
Its strata are almost perpendicular, inclining a few degrees
to the west.</p>

<p>The primitive region on the west side of Connecticut river,
included by the map, is made up of mica slate, as a prevailing
rock, particularly in the northern part. Hornblende slate
sometimes alternates with this, and sienite appears in various
places, though its strata are generally thin. Limestone also
occurs in Deerfield, Conway, Colrain, &amp;c. of a dull brown
colour. It contains so large a proportion of silex that it is
often but little removed from granular quartz. Lime for
building has sometimes been obtained from it. A range of
granite, containing veins of lead ore, appears at Southampton,
and proceeds to Hatfield. North of this, the other rocks
cover it, and it does not again rise within the limits of the map.</p>

<p>Sienite is the prevailing rock on the east side of Connecticut
river in the primitive region, more particularly in the
southern part. In some places a narrow stratum of mica slate
lies next to the conglomerate of the secondary formation, and a
low range of graphic and common granite has been observed
in Amherst and Leverett, lying next to the mica slate. Other
veins of granite also traverse the sienite; and gneiss occurs in
many places. The proportion of hornblende in the sienite
is generally small, and mica is often present in considerable
proportion. Porphyritic sienite is common in this quarter, and
steatite occurs in its eastern part.</p>

<p>Most of the primitive region on the map is broken and
mountainous, being made up of parallel ridges and detached
eminences. The strata run nearly north and south, and dip
to the east at angles between 20° and 60°. It would be easy
to extend the map on the west to the top of Hoosack mountain,
since the country is all primitive; and on the east the primi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>tive
continues, with a few exceptions, to the ocean. The map
might also be extended to the boundary of Connecticut, by
prolonging the primitive ranges with some divergency, and
colouring the intermediate space secondary, except a narrow
tract on the east side of Connecticut river, which is alluvial.
These extensions were not thought necessary.</p>

<p>In the town of Gill, at E, there is a cataract in Connecticut
river, from 30 to 40 feet in height; and it is believed that the
alluvial region, and part of the secondary shown on the map
from this fall to the place where the river passes between
mount Holyoke and Tom, was formerly the bed of a lake:
for the logs are still found undecayed in many places, from
10 to 20 feet below the surface; the river has evidently worn
a passage between Holyoke and Tom: many of the hills on
the northern part, and the sandstone on the plain, bear the
marks of having been washed by water, and the channels of
two rivers are still visible in Deerfield, the one 30, and the
other 100 feet above the present bed of Connecticut river.
Between mount Tom and the mountains west, there is a
secondary plain of sufficient height to throw back the water
over the supposed bed of the lake, before a passage was worn
between Holyoke and Tom. South of these hills commences
another alluvial and secondary tract, extending on both sides
of the river to Haddam, in Connecticut, where the river passes
between mountains, and perhaps this region also was the bed
of a lake.</p>

<p>The plain on which the village of Deerfield stands, with the
adjoining meadows, is sunk 50 or 60 feet below the general
alluvial tract, and was undoubtedly the bed of a pond, or small
lake, that remained after the larger one of which we have
spoken had subsided. When this larger lake decreased, Deerfield
river was cut off from a communication with the Connecticut
by the mountain CD, and the plain extending westward
from this mountain. There is a tradition, derived from the
aboriginals of Deerfield, that the passage in which Deerfield
river now runs through the mountain CD, was begun by a
squaw with a clam-shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>On the margin of these meadows, at considerable elevation,
numerous small conical excavations appear. On digging below
the surface, stones are found calcined by fire. These are
probably the spots where Indian wigwams formerly stood.
Many vestiges of the aboriginals are frequently found in
Deerfield, such as beads, stone pots, mortars, pipes, axes, and
the barbs of arrows and pikes. Near the village they had a
burial-ground, where many skeletons have been uncovered.
A roll of human hair was lately found here, by Mr. J. C. Hoyt
of Deerfield, three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and three
inches long, closely tied by a string made of the hide of some
animal, which string was encircled by brass or copper clasps
greatly oxidized; but the hair and string were in a good state
of preservation, though they must have lain there more than
a century. In the meadows, logs, leaves, butternuts, and walnuts
are found undecayed, 15 feet below the surface; and
stumps of trees have been observed at that depth standing yet
firmly where they once grew. In the same meadows, a few
years since, several toads were dug up from 15 feet below the
surface, and three feet in gravel. They soon recovered from
a torpid state, and hopped away.</p>

<p>The small range of hills beginning at the south line of Deerfield,
and terminating in Gill, deserves description. At its
commencement on the south, a conical hill, called Sugar Loaf,
of red conglomerate, rises abruptly from the plain 500 feet.
The appearance of this hill, as you come from the south, is
picturesque, and it is an interesting feature of the country.
The range becomes higher for three miles, where, at its
greatest elevation, it is 730 feet above the bed of Deerfield
river. The west side of the mountain is precipitous, and in
some places naked. The ascent on the other side is gentle.</p>

<p>Both sides of this hill are sandstone and puddingstone, frequently
alternating: though these are most extensive on the
west side, and as we rise the puddingstone predominates. The
strata dip to the east about 10 degrees. Near the centre of
this range is a ridge of greenstone, with a mural face on the
west, and amorphous masses lying at the base, half way up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
its summit. This ridge does not rise so high as the puddingstone
on the west of it, as may be seen in the view of strata
with the map. It commences on the west bank of Connecticut
river, about a mile north of the hill C, and increases in elevation
nearly to the spot where it disappears at the fall of the
river in Gill. This rock does not appear to rest on sandstone,
but to descend through it, where there is an opportunity for
observation. Deerfield river has worn a passage through the
sandstone and greenstone 150 feet deep, and the greenstone
passes under its bed, and the sandstone, at a few rods distant
lies on each side of the greenstone. A similar fact has been
noticed at the fall in Connecticut river, in Gill. Yet I have
coloured this greenstone secondary on the map; for it is certain
that Mount Tom rests on sandstone, and it is stated by
Professor Silliman, that the same rock does in Connecticut.
Could we penetrate deeper below the surface, it is probable
the same would be found to be the case with this greenstone.</p>

<p>As stated above, this rock disappears near the cataract in
Gill, and it is succeeded by puddingstone. But four miles
farther north, it again emerges in Bernardstone, though it
rises but little above the surface. Here its character is
changed. The hornblende is more crystalline, and the rock
becomes decidedly primitive, as you approach a mountain of
argillite and mica slate, into which it passes, and no greenstone
has been observed north of this. It terminates not far from
the line of Vermont. The red sandstone and conglomerate
also terminate on the opposite side of the river in Northfield.</p>

<p>The greenstone in the above described range, is of a finer
texture than the same rock in Connecticut; and the feldspar,
in some specimens, is scarcely discernible with a microscope.
Indeed, in many instances, the eye would decide the rock to
be basalt. Much of it is fissile, the laminæ varying from half
an inch to a foot in thickness. This is most perceptible among
the loose masses; but it exists also in that in place. Whether
this circumstance be accidental, I will not attempt to decide.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the greenstone of our vicinity constitutes
the base of amygdaloid. The imbedded substances are
calcareous spar, quartz, chalcedony, analcime, prehnite, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as will be more particularly mentioned hereafter. Globular
concretions of greenstone are common in this amygdaloid,
several inches in diameter, and of greater specific gravity than
the other parts of the rock. A great number of columns occur
in the same range, having from three to six sides. Some of
them are quite regular, and are well articulated, exhibiting at
their joints considerable concavities and convexities. They
are from one to thirty feet long, and, in their natural position,
incline a few degrees to the east, as may be seen in the view
of strata with the map; A few have been noticed that make
lateral curves. One of these hexagonal columns measures at
one end as follows:&mdash;Diagonals, 27, 29, and 29½ inches; sides,
16½, 13¼, 11½, 17, 11½, and 16½ inches. The convexity of
this column is a little more than an inch. The best instances
of these prisms occur one mile east from the village of Deerfield.</p>

<p>Masses of greenstone are found at considerable distance
from the range, among the puddingstone. One has been
noticed weighing many tons, a hundred rods from the range of
greenstone, and on much higher ground. Some of these
scattered fragments contain chalcedony. A specimen of petrosiliceous
porphyry has been found among the same puddingstone,
and also a mass of singular, though not well defined,
amygdaloid, whose base is similar to wacke, and imbedded
substances are calcareous spar, chlorite, and green earth.</p>

<p>The elevation in the north part of Sunderland, called Toby,
from 800 to 900 feet high, is chiefly conglomerate, red, brown,
or greenish, which, in some parts, alternates with chlorite
slate, secondary argillite, and a sandstone that seems to be
passing into gray wacke slate. Some of the imbedded masses
in this puddingstone are quite large, its cement is frequently
calcareous, its aspect is singular, and it is very different from
the puddingstone before described, On the opposite side of the
river. At the foot of this mountain, in the bottom of Connecticut
river, distinct impressions of fish are found on a
schistose rock, like the one above mentioned as passing into
gray wacke slate. This same species of slate occurs in several
other places at the bottom of Connecticut river, as at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fall in Gill. In this last place bituminous shale has been
noticed.</p>

<p>In Mount Toby, in Sunderland, is a cave nearly 150 feet
above the bed of Connecticut river. It opens to the north
and west, forming a quarter of a circle, is 130 feet in extent,
60 feet deep, and from 3 to 20 wide. A little to the south of
it, is a fissure in the puddingstone, formed by a separation of
the rock, ten feet wide, and as deep as the cave. So perfect
is this division, that it appears as if cloven down by the sword
of some Titan. Perhaps this cave and fissure were formed
by the washing of the waters of the lake we have mentioned
on the sandstone and conglomerate beneath; thus causing
the superincumbent rock to fall and separate. There is no
appearance of any other convulsion. Imperfect, calcareous
stalactites are found in this cave.</p>

<p>The falls in Connecticut river, at E, are not unworthy of
notice. The river here is about 40 rods wide, and the height
of the main cataract, raised considerably by an artificial dam,
is 30 feet. The fall continues two miles. On the north bank
you view the cataract from elevated ground, and can see
the river nearly a mile above and below&mdash;above, perfectly
smooth and calm, below, forming a quarter of a circle, and
tumbling among the broken rocks. On the opposite side of
the river are a few buildings, the commencement of a canal,
and, behind these, moderately elevated hills, covered with
woods. Two rocky islands near the middle of the descending
sheet, and another thirty rods below, add much to the beauty
of the view. Looking from the southeast shore, you have a
partial prospect of the falls, and a view of an amphitheatre of
greenstone hills, through which a small river empties. The
pleasure derived from the view proceeds more from its wildness
than its sublimity.</p>

<p>The position of the hills, boundaries, and rivers, on the
accompanying map, may not, in all cases, be precisely correct.
The general outlines were enlarged by a pentegraph from
Carleton's map of Massachusetts, and the intermediate objects
were placed chiefly by the eye; their relative situations being
determined by travelling over the ground, and viewing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
from different elevations. The boundaries of the several
formations have not been so carefully noticed near the angles
of the map as in the central parts. Of their correctness generally,
however, I am confident. The latitude and longitude
of Deerfield, from which those on the map were marked,
were obtained by taking a mean of the observations given by
Gen. E. Hoyt, in the Transactions of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences, and of twelve lunar observations since
made. The result is, Lat. 42° 32' 32". Long. 72° 39' from
Greenwich.</p>

<p>With the map is given a view of the strata of rocks from
Hoosack mountain to eleven miles east of Connecticut river,
on a line nearly east and west, passing through Deerfield.
The horizontal distances are laid down from a scale: the elevations
are assumed. The principal rocks only are coloured;
for it is very difficult to determine the breadth of many, since
they frequently alternate with one another. I have not examined
the country on the east side of Connecticut river with
sufficient care to be able to extend the section on that side
more than a few miles.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to mention, that Mount Holyoke, so
much celebrated for the delightful view from its top, has been
found, with a sextant, to be 830 feet above Connecticut river.
Its height has been frequently overrated.</p>

<p>The mineralogy of this section of the country has been but
imperfectly explored. I shall mention those minerals only of
which I have obtained specimens, and whose localities have
not been noticed by mineralogists.</p>

<p><em>Quartz</em>&mdash;several varieties.</p>

<div class="blockquot4">

<p>1. <em>Rock Crystal</em>&mdash;abundant. Some good specimens are found
in Conway, on feldspar, with the usual hexagonal, prismatic
crystals, and these crystals cross each other in
all directions.</p>

<p>2. <em>Irised Quartz</em>&mdash;found in Leyden.</p>

<p>3. <em>Granular Quartz</em>&mdash;in Deerfield.</p>

<p>4. <em>Radiated Quartz</em>&mdash;in Whately and Shelburne.</p>

<p>5. <em>Blue Quartz</em>&mdash;in rolled masses on the banks of Deerfield
river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <em>Greasy Quartz</em>&mdash;in same place.</p>

<p>7. <em>Pseudomorphous Quartz</em>&mdash;in greenstone, Deerfield.</p>

<p>8. <em>Lamellar Quartz</em>&mdash;in same place. The laminæ sometimes
penetrate crystals of common quartz.</p>

<p>9. <em>Tubular</em>, or <em>Pectinated Quartz</em>&mdash;in same place.</p>

<p>10. <em>Quartz Geodes</em>&mdash;in same place.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><em>Prase</em>&mdash;in the north part of Sunderland. (Not good specimens.)</p>

<p><em>Amethyst</em>&mdash;in Greenstone, Deerfield: the colour is not
deep, but delicate.</p>

<p><em>Chalcedony</em>&mdash;in same place&mdash;considerably abundant, but
generally in small masses.</p>

<p><em>Carnelian</em>&mdash;in same place, not plenty. The chalcedony, in
some specimens, seems to be passing into cacholong, and
the carnelian into sardonyx.</p>

<p><em>Agate</em>&mdash;in same place. It is made up of chalcedony, carnelian,
and quartz. They are generally small, but some
are elegant.</p>

<p><em>Jasper</em>, red, and yellow&mdash;found in rolled masses on the banks
of Deerfield river and in Leyden. Some have been found
imperfectly striped. It occurs frequently as it was formed
by the aboriginals into barbs for pikes and arrows.</p>

<p><em>Petrosilex</em>&mdash;on the banks of Deerfield river&mdash;not good specimens.</p>

<p><em>Feldspar</em>&mdash;the red variety occurs in puddingstone, Deerfield.
It is not necessary to mention any other locality of
a mineral so common.</p>

<p><em>Hornblende</em>&mdash;very abundant&mdash;mostly black in this vicinity.</p>

<p><em>Mica</em>&mdash;this is very abundant on the east side of Connecticut
river. Some crystals of it have been found in Amherst.</p>

<p><em>Talc</em>&mdash;in Shutesbury.</p>

<p><em>Steatite.</em> The localities of this are seen on the section.
The aboriginals formed many articles from this mineral,
as pots, pipes, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Chlorite</em>&mdash;in Shutesbury: also in amygdaloid, Deerfield.
In Deerfield academy there are some Indian pipes of this
mineral, well wrought.</p>

<p><em>Green Earth</em>&mdash;in small quantities, in amygdaloid, Deerfield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Schorl</em>&mdash;the black variety occurs in Pelham, Shutesbury,
and Orange, Mass., and in Brattleborough, Vermont.</p>

<p><em>Epidote</em>&mdash;in Deerfield, Shutesbury, Leyden, and Pelham,
and in Athol, Worcester county. The specimens poor.</p>

<p><em>Tremolite</em>&mdash;in the west part of Leyden, near Green river.
The rock in this region is chiefly mica slate, and the
quantity of tremolite is very great. Tons of it might be
easily collected.</p>

<p><em>Cyanite</em>, or <em>Sappare</em>&mdash;in Deerfield, in mica slate; discovered
by Dr. S. W. Williams.</p>

<p><em>Actynolite</em>&mdash;rare, found in Shutesbury.</p>

<p><em>Serpentine</em>&mdash;found in Leyden in rolled masses. Some of the
specimens admit a fine polish, and the ground is handsomely
variegated. It has not been noticed <em>in situ</em>.</p>

<p><em>Asbestus</em>&mdash;compact, in Pelham.</p>

<p><em>Garnets</em>&mdash;very plenty in Conway, Deerfield, Shelburne, &amp;c.
Good specimens of the melanite occur in Conway.</p>

<p><em>Native Alum</em>&mdash;in Leyden, in small quantities, efflorescing on
argillaceous slate.</p>

<p><em>Sulphur</em>&mdash;in Conway, Shelburne, and Warwick, efflorescing
on mica slate.</p>

<p><em>Prehnite</em>&mdash;in greenstone, Deerfield, encrusting the columns
and in radiated masses, but rarely crystallized. The
veins of it, when in place, are nearly perpendicular.</p>

<p><em>Zeolite</em>&mdash;in same place, not abundant. Some good specimens
of the radiated variety are found.</p>

<p><em>Chabasie</em>&mdash;in same place, considerably abundant. No crystals
have yet been found whose sides exceed a quarter of an
inch. It occurs in the veins of the greenstone, in geodes,
on balls of zeolite, on chalcedony, on lamellar quartz, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Stilbite</em>&mdash;in same place, not abundant. It is commonly associated
with chabasie, and the crystals, though small, are
well defined.</p>

<p><em>Analcime</em>&mdash;in same place, very abundant, and is associated
with quartz and amethyst, which are sometimes enclosed
by analcime. It generally occurs in cylindrical, reniform,
and radiated masses. A few perfect crystals only have
been observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Laminated Calcareous Spar</em>&mdash;in the same place, not uncommon.</p>

<p>Chalcedony, carnelian, agate, amethyst, prehnite, zeolite,
chabasie, stilbite, and analcime, have been found nearly

Essay on the Prairies and Barrens found in this country.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Description of the Prairies.</em></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prairie</i> is a French word, signifying a meadow, but is here
applied only to natural meadows. They are found in all the
states and territories west of the Allegany mountains, more or
less numerous, of greater or less extent. They are covered
with a coarse kind of grass, which, before the country is settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in their vicinity, grows to the height of six or seven feet.
After these natural meadows are fed upon by domestic animals,
the grass does not grow to a greater height than it does in
common pastures. Sometimes this grass is intermixed with
weeds and plum-bushes. Some of those prairies are dry, while
others are moist. Pickaway Plains, in Pickaway county, in the
State of Ohio, lying a small distance south of this place, are
nearly seven miles in length, and about three miles in width, on
ground considerably elevated above the Scioto river, almost perfectly
level, and, in their native state, were covered with a great
quantity of grass, some weeds and plum-bushes; and in the
most elevated places, there were a few trees. This was one
great prairie.</p>

<p>Sandusky Plains, lying on the high ground between the head
waters of the Whetstone branch of the Scioto river, and the
waters of streams running into Lake Erie, are still more extensive
than those of Pickaway, covered with a coarse, tall grass,
intermixed with weeds, with here and there a tree, presenting
to the eye a landscape of great extent.</p>

<p>The moist prairies generally lie along some stream, or at the
head of one, on level land, or on that which gently descends.
The moist prairies are too wet for trees to grow on them; and
whether moist or dry, the soil, for a greater or less depth, is
always alluvial, resting on pebbles and sand, such as are found
at the bottom of rivers, ponds, and lakes. In some instances,
the writer is credibly informed, that the shells of muscles are
found imbedded in the pebbles and sand. That these shells,
such as abound in our rivers, ponds, and lakes, should be
found in low prairies along the banks of waters which frequently
overflow them, excites no wonder, nor even surprise;
but that these shells should be found thus imbedded in pebbles
and sand underneath several feet of alluvial soil, in situations
more than one hundred feet above the waters of any stream
now in existence, is calculated to perplex the mind of the
superficial observer. These prairies are found in the western
half of the State of Ohio, and north of the hills adjacent to the
river of that name. They are also found in every state and
territory west of the Alleganies, from the great northern lakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
on the north, to the Mexican Gulf on the south; from the
western foot of the Allegany mountains, to the eastern one of
the Rocky mountains, up the Missouri. In summer, the grass
which spontaneously covers them, feeds immense herds of
cattle; in winter, the hay that is cut on them, with a little
Indian corn or maize, feeds and fattens the same herds. Some
of these prairies extend as far as the eye can reach; others
contain only a few perches of ground.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Description of the Barrens.</em></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>But besides these prairies, there are also extensive tracts of
country in this part of the Union which deserve and shall
receive our notice; they are called "<em>Barrens</em>." From their
appellation, "barrens," the person unacquainted with them
is not to suppose them thus called from their sterility, because
most of them are quite the reverse. These barrens are found
in a level country, with here and there a gentle rise, only a
few feet higher than the land around it. On these little rises,
for they are not hills, trees grow, and grass also; but grass
and weeds are the only occupants of the soil where there is
no rise of ground. The soil is alluvial to greater or less depth
in these barrens, though on some of the highest rises there is
little or none; the lower the ground the deeper the alluvion.
On these gentle rises, where there is no alluvion, we find stiff,
blue clay, and no pebbles. Under the alluvial black soil, in
the lower grounds, we find pebbles similar to those in the
prairies, owing to similar causes. On the little ridges, wherever
the land is not too moist, the oak or the hickory has
taken possession, and there grows to a moderate height, in
clusters. It would seem, that whenever the land had become
sufficiently dry for an acorn or a hickory-nut to sprout, take
root, and grow, it did so; and from one or more of these trees,
in time, others have grown around them in such clusters as we
now behold. Where the land is lower, the soil deeper, more
moist and more fertile, the grass was too thick, and the soil too
wet, for such kind of trees to grow in as were found in the
immediate vicinity. Imagine, then, natural meadows, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
various dimensions, and of every figure which the imagination
can conceive, with here and there a gentle rise of ground,
decked with a few scattering trees or a thick cluster of them,
and bearing a tall, coarse grass, which is thin on the rises, but on
the lower grounds thick and luxuriant; imagine, also, a rill of
a reddish colour scarcely meandering through ground a little
lower than the surrounding plain, and you will have a very
correct idea of the appearance of these barrens. They are
<em>generally</em> (not always) found on what, in our western dialect,
is called <em>second bottom</em>, and not on a level with any streams of
magnitude, but rather at their sources. To mention all the
counties of this State where these prairies and barrens are
found, would be too tedious, and illy comport with the object
which we have in view. We shall therefore content ourselves
with describing those found in the north half of Fayette county,
and the adjoining county of Madison, which may be said to be
almost entirely one great barren of more than forty miles
extent from north to south, and generally half as much in
breadth from east to west. The great barren in Fayette,
Madison, and, we may add, in the counties still north of them,
is on land elevated from fifty to one hundred feet above the
level of the Scioto river, into which the streams that have
their sources in this tract of country generally run. This
land lies so level that the waters stand on it too long for grain
to thrive equally with grass, unless, indeed, the farmer should
dig a long drain, which is easily effected by the plough, with
a little assistance from the hoe and the spade. But as nature
seems to have intended this tract of country for the raising of
cattle instead of grain, the husbandman has listened to the suggestion,
and in this great barren are found some thousands of
the finest cattle which the State affords. Here the horse, the
ox, and the swine feed, thrive, and fatten with little expense to
their owner; but sheep do not, and never will, thrive on
prairie grass, or wet grounds. Fruit-trees, the peach, the
apple, the plum, &amp;c. do very well when planted on the gently
rising grounds, where the hickory or the oak had once stood.
Fruit-trees, such as have been named, thrive very well also
on the dry prairies. On the eastern side of the Allegany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
mountains there neither is, nor was there ever, any thing like
these prairies and barrens, if we except those found in the
western part of New-York, in the Genesee country, and in
the vicinity of the lakes in that quarter. These, the writer of
this saw nearly thirty years since, and before that country was
much settled. Those prairies were similar in appearance
to ours in the west, and were, beyond doubt, formed by similar
means.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Speculations on the Origin of the Prairies and Barrens.</em></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>What were the causes which contribute to form these natural
meadows? That water was the principal agent in their formation,
we very little doubt; but this is not the common
opinion. According to that opinion, our prairies and barrens,
and especially the latter, were occasioned entirely by the
burning of the woods by the Indians, in order to take the wild
game. Let us try this opinion by the indubitable appearances
exhibited by these prairies and barrens.</p>

<p>They are invariably found in a level country, or in one
which is nearly so; and the soil is generally, if not always,
more moist than that which is uneven and hilly. Would not
the leaves, where the land is dry, burn over with as great
facility, or even with greater facility, than the grass would
where the land is wet? Would there not be more wild game
where they could find their food in plenty, such as acorns and
hickory nuts, on which they feed in winter, than on land
where no food, except dry grass and weeds, were to be found?
It is well known that these prairies and barrens could not
be burnt over when the vegetable productions which cover
them were growing. At the only season when it is possible
to burn them, that is in winter, to what kind of regions do the
wild animals resort? Is it not to the thick woods? Every
hunter will answer in the affirmative. For the space of twenty-five
years, the writer of this lived in the vicinity of Indians,
and from information on which he relies, as well as from his
own actual observation, he confidently avers that the Indians
neither are, nor ever were, in the habit of firing the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in order to take game. Erroneous information first propagated
such an opinion, and blind credulity has extended it down to
us. Another opinion, equally groundless, prevails to a considerable
extent; and that is, that these prairies have all been
heretofore cultivated by the aborigines, and that the grass having
overspread these plains, prevented the growth of trees on
them. The Indians, it is to be presumed, never cultivated
any other grain than maize, or Indian corn, and yet we see
few or no corn-hills in any part of this country. In the western
part of New-York, before it was settled by its present
inhabitants, thousands and thousands of acres were to be seen,
where the trees were as large as any in the forest, and yet the
rows of corn-hills were plainly discernible. I refer in a particular
manner to what is now called Cayuga county. There
the growth of grass had not prevented the growth of trees, nor
did it here. We know that some of these prairies were cultivated
by the Indians, but never to any very considerable
extent. This country never was thickly settled by Indians,
like the shores of the Atlantic and the banks of the rivers running
into it. No, it was the ancestors of the Peruvians and
the Mexicans who lived here in great numbers, before they
migrated to South America.</p>

<p>The question then recurs, by what powerful means were
these prairies and barrens formed?</p>

<p>That water was the principal agent, we infer from the fact,
that the soil is always alluvial to greater or less depth; the
former we call prairie, the latter barren. But how could the
country from the southern shore of Lake Erie to Chillicothe,
a distance of more than one hundred and fifty miles from north
to south, ever be covered with water long enough to form
alluvial soil, in many places from four to six feet in depth? I
answer, that the Niagara river, the present outlet of Lake Erie,
has worn away several hundred feet, and in that way the lake
is lowered in the same proportion. The high land, composed
entirely of sand, originally extending from the Ohio northerly
upwards of forty miles, to Chillicothe, has been worn through
by the Scioto river; and the waters which once for ages
covered the whole country north of the hills along the Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
river have been drained off, and the dry land appears where
once stood the waters of lakes Erie and Michigan, then forming
but one great lake. I am fully impressed with the belief,
that were the bottom of Niagara river as high as it once was,
the upper lakes would now, as formerly, empty themselves
into the Ohio by the Scioto and Miami rivers, and into the
Mississippi by the Illinois. I might proceed to examine every
part of the country where prairies and barrens are found; but
they have all been formed by the same agent, and that is water.
An objection to this opinion may be raised by some, that these
prairies and barrens are frequently found in the counties of
Delaware, Champaign, Madison, Fayette, &amp;c. on ground considerably
elevated. Are they higher than the hills near Chillicothe?
From a careful inspection, but without any instruments,
I am convinced that they are none of them as high.</p>

<p>There is no perpendicular fall of water, but merely a gradual
descent, from Columbus to the Ohio; nay, there is no
fall from the very source of the Scioto to its mouth. Every
one acquainted with hydrostatics, knows that water will run
briskly where the descent is only a few inches in a mile. The
writer believes that the Scioto, from its source to the Ohio
river, does not descend more than one hundred feet, and that
the present surface of Lake Erie is about on a level with the
Ohio in a freshet; that before the channel of Niagara river
was deepened, as it evidently has been, by the attrition of that
mighty stream; and before the hills adjacent to the Ohio were
worn down by the waters of the Scioto, the whole country
north of Chillicothe, where these hills commence, to Lake
Erie inclusive, was covered with water, except the very
highest hills in the counties of Greene, &amp;c. which were then
islands. What tends to corroborate this opinion is, that on
these high grounds we find limestone and other rocks, and
indications of gypsum; but no alluvion, and none of those fragments
and ruins which are produced by water acting mechanically
upon a country for a long space of time. We might
mention other parts of country where prairies and barrens
abound, and which have been formed by water. Those along
Greene river, in Kentucky, have evidently been covered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the waters of that river. The bed of that stream has been
deepened by the constant flowing of the water along its channel;
the water is drained off, and the prairies and barrens
now occupy the soil which the water had made and formerly
covered. The prairies above the falls of Hockhocking, along
that river, have evidently been formed in the same way, and
owe their origin and appearances to similar causes. There is
near Lancaster, on the last-mentioned river in the State of
Ohio, and near the great road, a gentle rise of ground in the
prairie, which has every appearance of having been an island,
and is so called by the people of the vicinity.</p>

<p>In fine, wherever prairies and barrens are found, there, for
a long space of time, water once stood, but was gradually
drained off. Else why alluvial soil to such a depth, in low
situations, and growing thinner as we ascend on ground more
elevated? Else why do we find rocks in more elevated tracts
of country, and not in prairies or barrens? Else why do we
find no alluvion, no grass, but a thick growth of ancient forest-trees
on the higher lands? Else why do we find beneath the
alluvion of the prairies, pebbles and shells similar to those at
the bottom of lakes and ponds? Else why do the higher grounds
to this moment present the appearances of so many islands?
And all these indications where no stream now in existence
could by possibility have reached them?</p>

<p>That the waters which once covered so great a part of this
State (Ohio) were drawn off gradually, we infer from the fact,
that there is not a single indication of the effects of an earthquake
or volcano, from the foot of the Allegany to the banks
of the Mississippi: in this region not a stone nor a layer of
earth has been misplaced, nor its position changed.</p>

<p>But an interesting inquiry here presents itself. Were the
hills along the Ohio, before they were worn away by the
streams which now empty themselves into that river, ever
high enough to raise the water to the north of them to such a
degree that it would overspread the country where the prairies
and barrens are now found? Although the height of these
hills has not been ascertained by the proper instruments, yet
from appearances, not to be mistaken by any person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
examines them and the country towards Lake Erie, these hills
are much higher than any land between them and that lake.
And from certain indications, (as already remarked,) had not
the bed of the Niagara been deepened by the running of that
mighty river, Lake Erie, as formerly, would empty itself into
the Ohio by the Scioto and Miami; and the great northern
lakes would once more discharge themselves into the Mississippi
by the Illinois. Lake Ontario, from some cause, (possibly
an earthquake, or the wearing away of its outlet, or both,)
is considerably lower than it was formerly: in that way the
land along its banks, once covered by its waters, is drained,
presenting appearances exactly similar to those seen in many
of our prairies.</p>

<p><em>Miscellaneous Remarks on the Prairies and Barrens relative to
their Picturesque Features, and to Agriculture and Health, as
affected by the peculiarities of these Tracts.</em></p></div>

<p class="p1" />
<p>To the traveller, who for several days traverses these prairies
and barrens, their appearance is quite uninviting, and
even disagreeable. He may travel from morning until night,
and make good speed, but on looking around him, he fancies
himself at the very spot whence he started. No pleasant
variety of hill and dale, no rapidly running brook delights the
eye, and no sound of woodland music strikes the ear; but, in
their stead, a dull uniformity of prospect "spread out immense."
Excepting here and there a tree, or a slight elevation of ground,
it is otherwise a dead level, covered with tall weeds and coarse
grass. The sluggish rivulets, of a reddish colour, scarcely
move perceptibly, and their appearance is as uninviting to the
eye, as their taste is disgusting to the palate. Such are the
prairies and barrens of the west; but, in order to make ample
amends for any deficiency, nature has made them exuberantly
fertile. The farmer who settles upon them, by raising cattle,
becomes rich with little labour. He ditches those which are
too moist for grain; he ploughs and fences them, and raises
from seventy to one hundred bushels of maize or Indian corn
to the acre, without ever hoeing it. The United States own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
thousands and thousands of acres of such land in these western
States and territories, which, for prompt payment, may be
purchased for one dollar and sixty-two and a half cents an
acre. One objection to these lands is, the want of timber for
fuel and other purposes; and another is, that they are unhealthy:
but in many places there is an abundance of peat in the
wet prairies, and cultivation will every year render them
more and more healthy. Some of them have been cultivated
for fifteen or twenty years past with grain, and are as fertile
as they ever were. As M. Volney says, "They are the
Flanders of America."</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Petersburgh</span>, <em>Virg. Jan. 28th, 1818</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pad1"><em>Dear Sir</em>,</span><br />

<span class="fs200">I</span>n compliance with your request, that I would send you some
account of the Virginia coal pits, I paid a visit to them soon
after my return, in company with Mr. R. W. Withers, and I
will now proceed to give you the account proposed.</p>

<p>The pits, which we made the particular object of our
visit, are situated in the county of Chesterfield, about 14 miles
distant, in a direction W. S. W. from Richmond, and 3 miles
south of James' River. The country rises gradually from
Richmond to the pits; and, from its sandy appearance, is evidently
an alluvial deposit, although its substratum is the granite
mentioned by Mr. M'Clure, as extending through this
state from S. S. W. to N. N. E. The coal is found on the
western or upper surface of the granite, coincident with it
both in direction and inclination; but whether they come immediately
in contact or not, has not yet been ascertained. The
'bed' of coal is supposed by the miners to be coextensive with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the granite, and I can discover no very good reason for disagreeing
with them in this particular; but, on the contrary,
many circumstances concur to strengthen the opinion that it is
really coextensive with the granite. The coal is now procured
from at least 25 different pits, opened at convenient distances
through an extent of from 50 to 70 miles. It every
where commences at the upper surface or termination of the
body of granite. Some suppose that it is imposed on the granite;
and others, that a thin stratum of slate is interposed between
the coal and granite. It is always found covered by
the slate. The granite is inclined to the horizon at an angle
of 45°, and the coal has the same inclination. And since the
coal, as far as it has been discovered, is found to accompany
and correspond with the granite, why may we not suppose
that it continues to accompany the granite, where it has not
yet been discovered? At Heth's pits, the coal is 50 feet thick,
measured on a line perpendicular to the surfaces of the extreme
strata. At some of the pits between Heth's and James'
River, it is 30 feet thick; and at the river, not more than 25
feet. The thickness of the coal on the north side of James'
River, at the pits in Henrico and Hanover counties, is variable,
but at no place greater than 25 feet; and to the south of
Heth's, in the pits extending to the Appomatox river, it is still
less thick. These facts would induce the supposition, that the
coal was deposited in a bed, near the centre of which Heth's
pits were sunk. But, on the other hand, the coal is distinctly
stratified, and the number of strata increases as the coal proceeds
from the surface of the earth; of course, therefore, the
farther you proceed from the outer extremity of the coal, the
thicker the body of it will be found; and from the inclination
of the coal, the farther you are from its outer extremity the
deeper it must be under the surface of the earth. Heth's pits
are 100 feet deeper than any that have yet been sunk; and
all the pits, that I have seen, appear to be nearer to the outer
extremity of the coal. We may conclude, therefore, that if
the others had been sunk as far from the outer extremity, they
would have been as deep, and the coal would have been found
as thick in them as in Heth's. Heth's pits, now so called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
were first opened about 30 years since, and worked to some
considerable extent. Experiencing, however, much inconvenience
from the near approach of the works to a part of the
coal which was on fire; and finding, from their unskilful mode
of mining, that the business was not profitable, they abandoned
the works, and filled up their shaft. Some few years after,
Mr. Heth obtained possession of the land; and, having imported
two Scotch miners, commenced working the coal again. He
has now three shafts open, in a line with each other, in the direction
of the vein. They are sunk near the brink of a steep
hill, which rises about 180 feet from the western bank of a small
brook. The depth of one of the shafts is 350 feet. The
other two are about 300 feet deep, each. A steam-engine, constructed
by Bolton &amp; Watt, is erected at the middle and deepest
shaft. It is used exclusively for pumping out water; but
I will not trouble you with an account of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i>,
as it would be only a repetition of your own description of the
same operation at the Cornwall mines. The coal is raised in
a box, called by the miners a <em>cowe</em>. These cowes contain about
two bushels each, and two of them are alternately rising and
descending in each shaft. They are raised by means of ropes,
fastened to a simple wheel and crank, which is turned by
mules. In sinking their shafts, they cut, in the first place, perpendicularly
(i. e. to the surface of the earth) through the
coal, to its lower surface; and then turning westwardly, they
open a horizontal gallery through the inclination of the vein,
to its upper surface; by this means, to use their own terms,
"gaining a double cut on it." Their principal gallery passes
(in the direction of the vein,) by the mouth of each shaft. Its
length is 1350 feet, and it is terminated at each end by a hitch
or dyke of hard sandstone. (The passage was stopped with
rubbish in such a manner as to prevent me from seeing the
stone myself, and the gentleman who escorted me through the
mines is my authority for its being sandstone; he might possibly,
however, have been mistaken, as it is difficult to ascertain
what a stone is, in such a place, until it is broken.) When
I was at the pits, they were preparing to blast through this
rock. At right angles to the principal gallery, they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
opened, at convenient distances apart, shorter galleries, running
westwardly, and these are again connected by passages
parallel to the first or principal gallery. Pickaxes are the
only tools used in working the coal, as it breaks very readily,
in the direction of the strata. The roofs of some of the passages
are perfectly smooth; and in such, the light of the lamps,
reflected from the great variety of colours in the coal, presents
a very brilliant sight. The gloomy blackness, however,
of most of the galleries, and the strange dress and appearance
of the black miners, would furnish sufficient data to the conception
of a poet, for a description of Pluto's kingdom. A
strong sulphurous acid ran down the walls of many of the galleries;
and I observed one of the drains was filled with a yellowish
gelatinous substance, which I ascertained, on a subsequent
examination, was a yellow, or rather a reddish, oxide
of iron, mechanically suspended in water.</p>

<p>I mentioned above that a part of the coal was on fire: I could
not ascertain when this fact was first observed to exist; and it
is not impossible that the coal may have been burning a century,
or more. It is highly probable, however, that a comparatively
small quantity of the coal is consumed, as the combustion
must be greatly retarded by the absence of a sufficient
portion of atmospheric air. A strong sulphurous fume issues
from an irregular hole in the side of the hill of about 2 feet
diameter. The hole appears to be only 4 or 5 feet deep, and
the smoke rises into it from cracks, partly filled with loose
clay. The earth is very much cracked around the hole, to
the distance of 12 or 15 feet; and these cracks are from 1 to
4 inches wide. The mouth of the hole is encrusted with acicular
crystals of pure sulphur. Attempts were formerly made
to extinguish the fire, by turning water into this hole; and,
after every attempt, there was a temporary disappearance of
the smoke for several weeks; but never longer than three
months. For several years, however, they have desisted
from such vain attempts, and have taken advantage of the facility
afforded, by the existence of this fire, for ventilating the
mines, in the following manner:&mdash;They opened a passage from
their present, to the old deserted, works; this they can open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
or shut, by means of a close door. As the old works are very
near the fire, the air in them becomes very much rarified by
the heat; and probably a considerable portion of it is consumed
(as the principal pabulum for the combustion,) and a partial
vacuum is produced. When the air in their present works,
therefore, becomes impure, they open the door, and a strong
current rushes into the old works; its place is again supplied
with fresh air through the shafts. Previous to the adoption
of this mode of ventilation, they experienced great inconvenience
from carbonic acid gas; and some of the workmen had
been killed by an explosion of carburetted hydrogen gas. Since
this mode has been adopted, they have experienced no inconvenience
at all from noxious gases. On inquiry, I was told
that the substances passed through, in getting to the coal, varied
in the different pits. As far, however, as I could learn
by inquiry, and an examination of the heaps of rubbish, the
following substances, in the order in which they stand, have
been found in Heth's pits:&mdash;mould, clay, gravel, fuller's earth,
sandstone, (at first extremely coarse and friable, but becoming
more compact and hard, and having an appearance somewhat
stratified as they descended,) gray and bluish clay slate, hard
bluish sandstone, shale, or, as they term it, shiver, white micaceous
sandstone, extremely hard; blue slate and shale intermixed,
black slate, and then the coal. The depth of these strata
differed so much in different pits, that their individual thickness
could not be ascertained. Vegetable impressions are
very common in the slate next the coal; and they have found
the impression of a fish. Pieces of pure charcoal, in the form
of sticks, or logs, are frequently found in or on the coal. In
sinking one of the pits they met with a perpendicular column,
8 inches in diameter, extending through the slate into the coal;
in all about 50 feet. Its surface was distinctly serrated, and
at intervals of about 2 inches it appeared jointed, breaking
easily at the joints. For the want of a better name I must call
it a "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lusus naturæ;</span>" for it is neither clay-slate nor mica-slate,
nor shale, nor sandstone; but appears to be composed of them
all. Masses of a black oxide of iron are sometimes found in
the slate; and from its weight and hardness the miners very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
properly call it ironstone. Iron pyrites are very abundant in
the slate, and the heaps of rubbish are white with the sulphate
of alumine; yellow ochre is found among the rubbish, but I
could not ascertain its relative position with any precision.
The side of the hill at the pits is covered with quartz pebbles;
some of which are as transparent and beautiful as I ever saw.
The country, for several miles around the pits, (i. e. as far as
I have seen,) appears to be entirely destitute of rocks or pebbles,
and is covered with a light sandy soil. I am unable to
inform you of the number of hands employed at, or of the quantity
of coal annually furnished from, these pits, as a part of my
notes has, by an accident, been rendered illegible.</p>

<p>Thus, sir, I have endeavoured to comply with my promise
of giving you an account of the coal pits.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In doing this, I
have <em>only</em> attempted to state facts as they existed; although I
have no doubt that my imperfect acquaintance with geology
has occasioned many omissions which might have been interesting.
To the same cause must be attributed the use of language
not always strictly scientific, and a method less exact
than might have been desired. With all its imperfections,
however, if you can, from the mass of facts, cull any one which
may be useful or interesting, I shall be fully compensated by
the pleasure of having furnished it, for any trouble I may have
been at in doing so. And, if at any time I should be able to
furnish you with any information relative to the mineralogy or
geology of this part of the country, I hope you will let me
know it.</p>

part of the State of Indiana, communicated in a letter to
the Editor, by Mr.</em> <span class="smcap">W. B. Stilson</span>.</p></div>


<p class="p1 right"><span class="smcap">Louisville</span>, (Ken.) August 11, 1818.</p>

<p><span class="pad1"><em>Dear Sir</em>,</span><br />

<span class="fs200">I</span> have employed a short period of leisure in passing over
a portion of the state of Indiana. Among other objects, I was
not wholly inattentive to the mineralogical and geological features
of the country. I now, with diffidence, transmit to you
the result of my inquiries.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">Sketch</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>The secondary formation of the state of Indiana is abundantly
evident. The surface of the soil is undulating, and marked
with few elevations which deserve the name of mountains.
The rocks are sandstone, limestone, and clay-slate; all of
which are disposed in horizontal strata. The sandstone presents
nothing remarkable in its appearance. Its colours are
various shades of gray and brown. The principal hills are of
this formation. The principal colours of the limestone are
blue and gray, and their various mingled and intermediate
shades. Its secondary formation is very manifest from its
almost earthy appearance. In innumerable instances, the
limestone rocks contain immense quantities of imbedded shells,
of great similarity in form and appearance, and having considerable
resemblance, to the common escallop-shell of the
ocean. Owing to the easy decomposition of these rocks, and
the horizontal position of their strata, they afford many subterranean
passages for water. A considerable stream, called
Lost River, runs into a cave in the side of a precipitous hill;
and, after a passage of 6 or 7 miles under the earth, again
makes its appearance, with a large accession to its waters.
The traveller's attention is continually excited by cavities in
the earth, where the temporary rivulets, proceeding from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rains, make a sudden exit through perpendicular perforations
in the upper stratum of the rock. There are many such cavities,
which do not receive any water from the surface. Some
of them are many yards in diameter, forming a regular circular
concave, of considerable depth towards the centre. They are
vulgarly known among the inhabitants by the name of "<em>sink-holes</em>."
The localities of slate are few, and present nothing
uncommon.</p>

<p>With regard to the particular minerals. On Sand Creek,
60 miles from White River, is an interesting locality of that
variety of silex, commonly called burrstone. It has been
examined by several practical millers, who do not hesitate to
pronounce the specimens which it affords, equal, if not superior,
to the French burrs. The locality is twenty acres in extent,
and appears to be inexhaustible. The mineral varies very
much in its appearance; it is generally porous, and appears
to have been puffed up by the escape of some gas, while it
was in a state of fusion. A mass of well-raised bread gives no
inadequate idea of its configuration. It produces most vivid
sparks with steel. Some labourers are employed in procuring
millstones from this place; and, such is the size of the siliceous
rocks, that they are under no necessity of constructing
them of detached masses. They form, of a single rock, millstones
of five and a half feet in diameter, which are not defaced
by any irregularity, or even earthy cavity. These millstones
may be carried down the White, Wabash, Ohio, and
Mississippi rivers, to New-Orleans, with great facility. And
if they should prove as excellent as it is expected they will,
this discovery will shed new lustre upon the accumulating evidence
of the mineralogical resources of this republic.</p>

<p>Many other varieties of silex are common: rock crystal,
agate, and chalcedony, are often found in the beds of rivulets. I
passed a considerable distance upon the banks of a small stream,
called Leather-wood creek: the bottom of the creek was covered,
the whole distance, with siliceous masses, shaped like
oblate spheroids, and of every size, from that of a large melon
downwards. On being broken, they presented beautiful geodes
of crystallized quartz, amethyst, &amp;c. The outside was often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
fine chalcedony, and sometimes the interior was the same substance,
in the form of balls; all these were sometimes combined,
forming agates of great beauty.</p>

<p>Carbonate of lime, crystallized, is sometimes found; and
many of the caves afford fine stalactites.</p>

<p>There is a large cave near Corydon, celebrated for the production
of sulphate of magnesia, or Epsom salts. It has been
explored for the distance of several miles. When it was first
discovered, the bottom, in many places, was covered to the
depth of several inches, with pure, brilliant, needle-shaped
crystals of sulphate of magnesia. By some mysterious process
of nature, or rather of Divine benevolence, the production of
this useful salt is continually going on. This cave also produces
some other salts in small quantities: nitrate of lime, nitrate
of magnesia, sulphate of lime, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Where the basis of the country is limestone, the waters
always take up a great quantity of lime, and some of them possess
great petrifying powers. I saw many specimens of petrifactions:
a tuft of moss, the form perfectly preserved; leaves,
bark, and branches of trees; insects, and many others.</p>

<p>Many of the springs are strongly impregnated with sulphur,
and some of them are saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen.
I found the opinion universally prevalent among the people of
this state, that the first appearance of these sulphur springs
was immediately subsequent to the earthquakes of 1812. They
say, that then new springs, impregnated with sulphur, broke
out, and the waters of some old springs, for the first time, gave
indications of this mineral. A sensible farmer, who has a large
sulphur-fountain, boiling up from the bottom of a river near
its bank, assured me, that there was no trace of this spring
until after the period to which I have alluded. He could
have no interest in deceiving me; and if he did deceive me,
his conduct could originate only in that love of the marvellous
which is so characteristic of the human mind. He moreover
assured me that the "water had been growing weaker, (to
use his phrase) ever since its first appearance." I have room
only to mention, among the minerals of Indiana, many varieties
of clay, ochres, gypsum, alabaster, muriat of soda, (very common,)
iron ore, and antimony.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. V. New localities of Agate, Chalcedony, Chabasie,
Stilbite, Analcime, Titanium, Prehnite, &amp;c.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> &nbsp; <em>New localities of Agate, Chalcedony, Chabasie,
Stilbite, Analcime, Titanium, Prehnite, &amp;c.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">D</span>eerfield, &amp;c. In the account of the Mineralogy and
Geology of Deerfield, by Mr. Hitchcock, in the present
Number, it will be seen, that these interesting minerals (with
the exception of titanium) exist in the secondary greenstone
of that place. We have specimens, (through the kindness
of Mr. Hitchcock,) and observe that the agates, chalcedony,
analcime, and prehnite, are imbedded in the trap;
the agates are in some instances very delicate in the disposition
of their bands, and need nothing but polishing to make
them beautiful; the same is true of the chalcedony. The
chabasie and stilbite occupy cavities, and the chabasie is often
distinctly crystalized in a rhomboid, so nearly approaching a
cube, in the quantity of its angles, that the mistake is easily
committed of supposing them to be cubes; the crystals are
sometimes transparent, and the largest a quarter of an inch in
diameter. Titanium is found in Leyden; it is the red oxide&mdash;very
well characterized&mdash;in reddish brown crystals as large
as a common goose quill,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and, in some instances, perfectly
geniculated. It is rare to see finer specimens.</p>

<p><em>East-Haven.</em> It will be observed, that the great ranges of
secondary greenstone, which cut Connecticut and Massachusetts
in two, terminate at New-Haven, on the one hand, and
some way above Deerfield on the other. By comparing the
account of the termination at New-Haven (Bruce's Journal,
v. i. p. 139.) with that now published, of the termination at
or near Deerfield, it will be seen that the geology and imbedded
minerals are very similar. At East-Haven, (one of the
branches of the greenstone of New-Haven, and within from
three to four miles of the latter town,) chalcedony is often
found, sometimes imbedded in the trap, (but perhaps more
frequently loose among the fallen stones,) which, although in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
small pieces, is as perfect in its characters as the chalcedony
of the Feroe Islands. It is of a delicate gray, translucent,
mamillary, botryoidal, stalactitical, or impressed by crystals
of quartz, which have usually fallen out; sometimes these
crystals incrust the chalcedony.</p>

<p>Agates also are found in considerable numbers, both imbedded
and loose. They usually consist of bands of chalcedony
and quartz, and sometimes of the latter only, variously striped
or spotted, or interlaced with jasper, carnelian, and cacholong.</p>

<p>The form of the imbedded agates at East-Haven is commonly
ovoidal, or egg-shaped, and frequently it is conical.
Some portions of pure chalcedony occur, which are shaped
like a long, slender carrot or parsnip, and the situation of the
latter in the ground would exactly represent that of the chalcedony
or agate in the rock.</p>

<p>The imbedded masses are frequently altogether quartz, and
then they are most commonly geodes or hollow balls lined
with crystals, commonly very perfect and brilliant, although
rarely large. These crystals are commonly transparent and
colourless&mdash;but they exhibit also most of the varieties of
colour which quartz assumes&mdash;the amethyst&mdash;the smoky&mdash;yellow,
&amp;c., and occasionally they are tipped and spotted
with red jasper.</p>

<p>The spontaneous decay of these trap rocks causes many
specimens to be found among their ruins, and many more are
imbedded in the solid rock; but the industry of successive
classes from the neighbouring college, issuing from Col. Gibbs's
cabinet, has now made specimens more scarce.</p>

<p><em>Woodbury.</em> Twenty-four miles from New-Haven, N.W.</p>

<p>In a geological sketch of parts of the counties of New-Haven
and Litchfield, which may appear in a future Number,
it will be seen that prehnite, stilbite, and agate are found at
Woodbury, in the little basin of secondary greenstone which
exists there; the prehnite is abundant&mdash;it is not known
whether the agates are so, although it is asserted to be the
fact; the stilbite was not observed to be abundant, although it
was well characterized.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> &nbsp; <em>Account of the Strata perforated by, and of the
Minerals found in, the great adit to the Southampton
Lead Mine. Communicated to the Editor by Mr.</em> <span class="smcap">Amos
Eaton</span>, <em>Lecturer on Geology, Botany, &amp;c.</em></p></div>


<p class="center"><em>To Professor Silliman.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">A</span>fter a laborious geological excursion along M'Clure's
Springfield section, for about one hundred miles, I visited
Dr. D. Hunt, at Northampton. He observed that you had
expressed an opinion, that an attentive examination of all the
strata constituting the walls of the artificial avenue or drift at
the Southampton mines, would bring facts to knowledge,
which might, in some degree, subserve the cause of geological
science. I am now at the mouth of the drift, having just
completed the labour which you had marked out.</p>

<p>I employed two miners to commence with me, at the termination
of the drift, which is now extended 800 feet into the
hill. We broke off large specimens, at very short intervals,
throughout the whole extent of the drift. We arrived at its
mouth with almost a boat load of specimens. I kept a memorandum
of every thing which occurred, while under ground;
and I have now arranged the specimens, before the mouth of
the drift, in the same order in which they were situated in
the earth.</p>

<p>Fatigued as I am, I will make my remarks here, in the
field, lest something should hereafter escape me, which is
now fresh in my recollection. Beginning with the greatest
distance to which the miners have penetrated, I will set
down my remarks, in fact, in reversed order.</p>

<p>800 feet. The rock is fine-grained gray granite, traversed
by veins, lined with quartz crystals, and mostly filled with
calcareous spar, often beautifully crystallized. In the same
veins blue and purple fluate of lime and copper pyrites frequently
occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>790 feet. The same fine-grained granite is continued,
occasionally traversed by veins lined with crystals of quartz;
but containing no other minerals.</p>

<p>774 feet. A narrow vein of sulphuret of lead, with walls
lined with crystals of quartz. The fairest cubic crystals are
slightly attached to the points of the quartz crystals. Yellowish
crystals of carbonate of lime are often interspersed
among the lead. Sulphate of barytes occurs here also; sometimes
in plates meeting at various angles, and forming chambers
lined with minute crystals of quartz. Minute crystals of
copper pyrites and a little fluate of lime have been found
here; also fine specimens of bitter spar. The walls are very
compact, fine-grained granite.</p>

<p>760 feet. Coarse, parti-coloured granite. The felspar is
flesh-coloured and white; the quartz often bluish or greenish;
the mica silvery, greenish, or purplish.</p>

<p>725 feet. A stratum of gray-wacke slate. Texture less
firm than of the same rock at the west of Pittsfield. This
stratum is very distinct, and about two feet thick.</p>

<p>723 feet. A stratum of serpentine rock, containing very
red quartz imbedded in various directions. It is very compact,
and mostly green. Here it is but about three feet thick.
About ten miles south of this place, on Maclure's Springfield
section, near the line between Westfield and Russel, and
four miles west from Westfield Academy, I found this same
stratum of very great breadth. I say the same stratum,
because it is situated in the granitic hill, east of the highest
ridge of granite, which is evidently a continuation of this
range. Perhaps I may, hereafter, give you an account of
my excursion along that section of Maclure, in which I may
give you a more particular description of the Westfield serpentine.</p>

<p>720 feet. Coarse granite, with white and flesh-coloured
felspar, black and silvery mica.</p>

<p>700 feet. A stratum of red mica slate, about four feet
thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>694 feet. Coarse, flesh-coloured granite. This is the
handsomest granite in the whole drift. Here we find the most
beautiful specimens of graphic granite, both flesh-coloured and
gray.</p>

<p>680 feet. A stratum of Kirwan's stell-stein. That is, an
aggregate of fine-grained quartz and mica, without any felspar.
The quartz is mostly greenish, probably coloured by the next
stratum.</p>

<p>670 feet. Beautiful green soapstone. Very compact, but
rather softer than that kind in common use for inkstands.</p>

<p>666 feet. A green, granular aggregate. It seems to be
made up of fine fragments of quartz, soapstone, and mica,
rarely a little felspar, slightly compacted together.</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em> All the strata, from the inner termination of the
drift to this place, a distance of one hundred and thirty-four
feet, are nearly vertical, or a very little inclined. Here they
begin to approach a horizontal position.</p>

<p>The green aggregate continues as far as the air-well, a distance
of 66 feet, with some trifling variations in the size and
proportions of the aggregated fragments.</p>

<p>500 feet. A granulated, schistose aggregate, chiefly of
quartz and mica. Though the constituents and the form of
the rock correspond very nearly with mica slate, it cannot be
considered as the primitive mica slate rock. It is so slightly
compacted that it can scarcely be kept from falling to pieces.
Its position is nearly horizontal.</p>

<p>480 feet. A stratum of coal, half an inch thick. This
stratum may be traced, at different intervals, one hundred and
eighty feet along the drift towards its mouth. It lies between
the strata of the last described schistose aggregate.</p>

<p>400 feet. An aggregate appears, alternating with the loose
schistose rock, which resembles the red sandstone, but is of
a less firm texture.</p>

<p>From this place all the strata, east of the soapstone, occasionally
appear, for the distance of about three hundred feet.
This is probably on account of their undulatory forms and
horizontal position. Most of the way we find the lower part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the walls to consist of a kind of semi-indurated puddingstone.
Sometimes a thin stratum of fine, loose sand occurs.
At 300 feet the coal stratum disappears, passing below the
bottom of the drift.</p>

<p>The last hundred feet is chiefly gravel, which is now supported
by timbers.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. VII. On the Peat of Dutchess County.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> &nbsp; <em>On the Peat of Dutchess County&mdash;read before
the Lyceum of Natural History, in New-York, by the
Rev.</em> <span class="smcap">F. C. Schaeffer</span>, <em>of New-York, and by him communicated
to the Editor</em>.</p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>n May, 1817, I brought specimens of marl and <em>peat</em> from
Dutchess county, which were taken from a fen or bog occupying
an area of some acres. These fens occur frequently in
the towns of Rhinebeck, Northeast, Clinton, &amp;c. in Dutchess
county. During a part of the year they are covered with
water.</p>

<p>A pit was dug in the bog from which I procured the specimens.
The order and depth of the well-defined strata which
were exhibited by this excavation, I noted in my memorandum
book, from which I extract the following:</p>

<p>After clearing away the fresh sod and recent vegetable
mould, there appeared,</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. A stratum or bed of <em>peat</em> commonly called <em>turf</em>, varying
in depth from three to four feet.</p>

<p>2. A stratum of peat and marl commingled; depth two
feet.</p>

<p>3. A stratum of pure marl, from two to three feet. Below
these there was an appearance of sand and blue clay.</p></div>

<p>The first, or upper stratum, consists of <em>compact peat</em>. This
substance, when first taken up, is of a dark brown colour, soft,
and rather viscid. Some vegetable fibres and vacuous seeds
are distributed throughout the mass. It may be moulded to
any convenient form. When perfectly dry, the texture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
this variety, of which there is a specimen before you, acquires
a high degree of solidity. Its fracture is earthy; the colour is
lighter.</p>

<p>I should not have offered more on this subject than the
labelled specimen, had I not made a most satisfactory experiment
with this kind of fuel, which may be obtained in great
abundance in our own State. It is easily kindled; burns with
a bright flame; yields a bluish smoke, and produces an odour
similar to that which attends the combustion of gramineous
substances. But this is momentary. When thoroughly kindled,
it burns with less flame, yields a small proportion of
blackish smoke, and sulphurous acid gas is evolved, though I
cannot discover any pyrites. It burns for a long time, and emits
a great body of heat. It leaves a very small proportion of light,
grayish white ashes; on which I have as yet made no experiments,
having this day, for the first time, paid particular attention
to this substance, attracted by the unusual hardness which
it acquired since it is in my possession: and not many hours
have elapsed since I subjected it to combustion. The attempt
succeeded so well, that I cannot refrain from expressing my
opinion, that this variety of peat will answer as an excellent
substitute for the best Liverpool coal.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>The southern and more mountainous part of the island consists
of <em>trap</em> rocks; more particularly of trap breccia and
wacké-porphyry. On these beds rests a series of very peculiar
stratified conglomerate rocks. These strata vary exceedingly
in colour and thickness, but all dip, at a considerable
angle, to the northwest. The more usual character of this
rock, is that of a clayey basis, with minute particles of felspar, and
small spots of <em>grünerde</em><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> (or chlorite Baldogée.) This latter is
frequently diffused over the whole, and gives it a green tinge:
the colour has been thought by some to proceed from the impregnation
of copper, but I am rather of opinion that is owing to
manganese and iron. The conglomerate character of this rock, is
derived from its having imbedded in it, or incorporated with
it, numerous fragments, of all sizes, of petrified wood, chert,
with and without coralline impressions, agate, jasper, amygdaloid,
greenstone, hornstone, porphyry, porphyry slate, and
other substances.</p>

<p>On this singular class of strata, reposes an extensive calcareous
formation, occupying the northern and eastern part of
the island, having <em>subordinate</em> to it, and at its lowest part, where
it is in contact with the conglomerate, large beds and patches
of chert, which contains also a vast variety of petrified woods,
several of which are of the palm tribe, with silicified shells,
chiefly <em>cerithea</em>; though at the Church-hill, at St. Johns, formed
of this chert, casts of bivalve and ramose madrepores are likewise
found. The calcareous beds are principally of a friable
marl, with blocks and layers of limestone irregularly included.
In this <em>formation</em><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> are many fossil shells, both in the calcareous
and siliceous state; and there appear to be some beds, wherein
is a mixture of shells of marine, and others of a fresh water,
or at least a terrestrial origin. The coralline agates found in
nodules and patches therein, and which may readily be distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>from the coralline chert of the previous beds, are
the most beautiful which have any where been yet noticed;
and when well selected and polished, make very pleasing
ornaments.</p>

<p>The island, as well as Barbuda, thirty miles to the northward,
the Grande Terre part of Guadaloupe, at a similar distance
to the southward and eastward, with several others of
the West-India Islands, give proof of an extensive formation,
more recent than those to which naturalists have heretofore
principally confined their' attention; and which is, perhaps,
contemporaneous with, if not later than, the Paris Basin, so
well described by Cuvier and Brongniart.</p>

<p class="p1 right"><span class="smcap">New-York</span>, October 19, 1818.</p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Dear Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="fs200">I</span> forward you a few mineral specimens characteristic of
Staten-Island, including native carbonate of magnesia, in acicular
crystals. I discovered this new form and locality of mag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>nesia
in examining the strata exhibited in an excavation now
making, under the delusive expectation of finding gold, about
three miles from the Quarantine. In descending the shaft,
sunk perpendicularly in steatite, magnesite, veins of talc, and
green translucent asbestus were observed at depths from six
to thirty-five feet. The magnesite was found to embrace veins
and cavities containing native carbonate of magnesia, in very
white acicular crystals, grouped in minute fibres radiating from
the sides, but not always filling the veins and cavities. The
crystals were, in some instances, suspended, assuming a stalactical
form. This carbonate of magnesia dissolves entirely
in diluted sulphuric acid, with considerable effervescence and
chemical action, producing a bitter compound, from which salts
of easy solution are formed by evaporation. The magnesite in
which these crystals are found, appears to be composed of carbonate
of magnesia, steatite, and talc, disintegrating readily
upon exposure to air and moisture: it effervesces considerably
in sulphuric acid, forming a very bitter fluid that soon exhibits
crystals, indicating that magnesia enters in large proportion
into its constitution. Magnesite may perhaps be found at
this place in quantity sufficient for a successful manufacture of
Epsom salts. Small regular hexaedral crystals of mica, were
noticed in steatite. Chromate of iron was sparingly diffused
through the different minerals raised from various depths.</p>

<p>A few remarks and facts respecting the geology and mineralogy
of Staten-Island, may, perhaps, give some additional
interest to the specimens presented.</p>

<p>Staten-Island (which constitutes Richmond county) is situated
about seven miles southwest of the city of New-York,
extends from northeast to southwest about fifteen miles, in a
straight line, with an average width of six. It exhibits a considerable
diversity of surface. The eastern part is composed
principally of elevated ground: a mountain chain is observed
to take its rise in the vicinity of a narrow sound called the
Kills, and sweep, in a semicircular form, near the eastern
shore; it then ranges southwest, parallel with, and distant
from Amboy Bay, about two miles, terminating near the centre
of the island, and forming, with the exception of some passages, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
continued chain, which, on the eastern and southern sides, is
very steep, but not precipitous; it gradually declines to the
west and north, and, in some places, it presents on its summit
table land of considerable extent. A prominent ridge crosses
the island, connecting the elevated ground of the south, with
the hills of the northern part. A species of steatite, containing
veins of common, indurated, and scaly talc, amianthus,
and most of the varieties of asbestus, and some chromate of
iron, constitutes the nucleus of the whole mountain range and
elevated ground of the eastern division, stamping it as primitive.
This steatite approaches, in most places, within a foot
and a half of the surface, and appears in small angular loose
blocks, wherever the soil has been removed. Its colour is a
greenish yellow; it is brittle, very adhesive to the tongue,
but little unctuous, and probably contains more alumine and
less magnesia than steatites in general. Much of it decomposes
when exposed to air and moisture, and forms a good
mould, whenever the descent of ground permits an accumulation
of earth. It is not improbable, that in most places of the
Staten-Island hills, when magnesia constitutes a considerable
ingredient of the rock, it will be found saturated with carbonic
acid, obviating the objection to common magnesian minerals in
agriculture.</p>

<p>The minerals observed on the surface of the northeast part
of this chain of hills are, secondary greenstone, asbestoid,
sandstone, granite, and gneiss, sparingly scattered in rolled
masses. In addition to these rocks, in the middle and western
part of the chain, a mineral of uncommon appearance is
observed. It is composed principally of quartz, rough, with
numerous cells of various forms, in which small siliceous crystals
are generally found: the veins or plates of quartz that
intersect each other, often embrace talc and oxide of iron,
which, decomposing, gives some specimens the appearance of
volcanic origin. Associated with this cellular ferruginous
quartz, brown hæmatite is often observed; this valuable ore
often yields eighty per cent. of iron of best quality; its fibres
assume a variety of shapes; they were observed at Staten-Island,
straight and curved, radiating from a centre, and exhi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>biting
the stalactical, cylindrical, and botryoidal forms, often
displaying a black polished surface and glistening lustre.
Ferruginous minerals are abundant on the mountain for several
miles. A granular oxide, called by miners shot-ore,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> from
its being principally composed of spherical grains of various
sizes, was often noticed, and appears in some places in extensive
beds: it is easily fused, and affords a large per centage of
good iron for castings. A heavy ore, with a smooth surface
and some lustre, bearing a considerable resemblance to native
iron, is sometimes seen. Banks of white sand, resembling the
siliceous particles of the seashore, are noticed on the mountain
tops, containing masses of compact, heavy ferruginous
sandstone, similar to the rocks of our alluvial seaboard. Large
beds of water-worn siliceous pebbles, in no way differing from
those washed by the ocean, are seen on the height of the
ridge, in which excavations have been made several feet,
leaving the depth of the mass uncertain. On some of the
eminences, for a considerable extent, vegetation is entirely
excluded by an iron-bound soil. Iron ore, imbedded in an
earth coloured by, and partly composed of, oxide of iron,
occupies the surface; and chalcedony and radiated quartz are
sometimes observed on the primitive ridge. Prospects from
many of these eminences are extensive and diversified. On
one side, the ocean and a great extent of coast are in view;
on the other, a rich landscape of hills and plains, the eye resting
on the highland-chain and the mountains bordering Pennsylvania;
the harbour, at your feet, presents a busy, ever-varying
scene, and the city of New-York appears to great
advantage from this point of observation.</p>

<p>The district between the mountain and the narrows, the
thickly settled and well-cultivated plain bordering Amboy bay,
and much of the western division of the island, are decidedly
alluvial. Adjacent to Fort Tompkins, detached pieces of copper
ore have been found. I have observed petrifactions of
marine shells in rocks excavated in that neighbourhood,
twenty feet from the surface, and sixty above the ocean.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>The western part of the island presents moderate elevations;
the soil, a good medium of sand and clay, is in general
fertile; but a tract near the termination is sandy and barren.
Some creeks penetrate to near the centre of the island, and
are bordered by extensive salt meadows. Except at the primitive
range, I have observed in no part of the island large
beds of rock that can be called in place; but rolled masses of
greenstone, sandstone, gneiss, granite, red jasper, and indurated
clay, appear in general sparingly, but sometimes in
abundance, on the surface. Lignite has been found in small
quantities in the western part of the island. A chalybeate
spring, of no great strength, is the only mineral water met
with in Richmond county. The ponds, wells, and streams,
contain a soft water, holding no lime in solution.</p>

in the Transactions of the Philosophical Society, in Philadelphia,
Vol. VI., and in Bruce's Journal, Vol. I. p. 100. The
following communication arose from a conversation on that
subject between Dr. Brown and the Editor.</p>


<p class="p2 right"><em>New-Haven, July 27, 1818.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have just found the passage I referred to the other day,
relative to the existence of native or sandrock nitre in the
interior of Southern Africa. It is in Barrow, and not in Vaillant,
as I thought when I had the pleasure of conversing with
you concerning it. I am much obliged to you for recalling
my attention to that curious subject, as it has brought to my
recollection a fact, which I believe I omitted to mention in
my memoir, (viz.) the existence of a black substance in the
clay under the rocks, of a bituminous appearance and smell.
This I remember to have seen in a rock-house, near the Kentucky
river, where very considerable quantities of sandrock
nitre had been obtained. This substance was found in masses
of a few ounces weight, and in the crevices of the rocks near
the basis of the side walls. The smell was not wholly bituminous,
but resembled that of bitumen combined with musk.
I am quite unable to account for the formation of the nitre, or
the production of this black substance which sometimes accompanies
it, both in Africa and America. Had I seen Mr. Barrow's
travels, when I noticed the bitumen, I should certainly
have paid more attention to it. But perceiving no relation
between the rock nitre and the masses of this substance, my
examination of it was much too superficial. I do not very
well understand what Mr. Barrow means by saying, that many
wagon loads of animal matter lay on the <em>roof</em> of the caverns in
Africa. I saw no such matter on the <em>roof</em> of the rock-houses
in Kentucky. Certainly the caverns have been the habitations
of wild beasts, and great quantities of leaves, &amp;c. have
been mixed with the debris of the superincumbent rocks,
but it does not seem probable, that much animal matter could
be filtrated through a roof of rock, perhaps forty or fifty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in thickness. The subject, however, is very curious, and
deserves much more attention than any of us have bestowed
upon it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><em>Extract from Barrow's Southern Africa, p. 291. New-York
edition.</em></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>"About 12 miles to the eastward of the wells, (Hepatic
wells,) in a kloof of the mountain, we found a considerable
quantity of <em>native nitre</em>. It was in a cavern similar to those
used by the Bosgesmans for their winter habitations, and in
which they used to make the drawings above mentioned.
The <em>under surface</em> of the projecting stratum of calcareous
stone, and the sides that supported it, were incrusted with a
coating of <em>clear, white saltpetre</em>, that came off in flakes, from a
quarter of an inch to an inch or more in thickness. The
fracture resembled that of refined sugar, it burnt completely
away without leaving any residuum; and if dissolved in water,
and thus evaporated, crystals of <em>pure prismatic nitre</em> were
obtained. This salt, in the <em>same</em> state, is to be met with
<em>under</em> the sandstone strata of <em>many</em> of the mountains of Africa;
but, perhaps, not in sufficient quantities to be employed as an
article of export. There was also in the same cave, running
down the sides of the rock, a black substance, that was apparently
bituminous. The peasants called it the urine of the
das. The dung of this gregarious animal was lying upon the
roof of the cavern to the amount of many wagon loads. The
putrid animal matter, filtrating through the rock, contributed,
no doubt, to the formation of the nitre. The Hepatic wells
and the native nitre rocks were in the division of Agster
Sneuwberg, which joins the Tacka to the southwest."</p>

<p>Should I ever visit Kentucky again, I hope that I shall be
able to give a better account of these caverns, which certainly
are highly deserving of the attention of naturalists.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia you may have an opportunity of seeing
some small specimens of the sandrock, containing nitre, now
in the cabinet of the Philosophical Society.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he sponges are one of the most singular productions of
nature; and, even to this time, naturalists are divided in
opinion respecting their real rank in the scale of organized
beings. Some believe that they are animals, belonging to the
class of polyps, next to the genus of <i>alcyonium</i>, while many
contend that they are not animals, but plants, of the tribe of
<i>fuci</i>, or marine vegetables. I am inclined to adopt this latter
opinion, since in all those which I have seen, in Europe and
America, no perceptible motion nor sensibility was to be discerned
in any stage of their existence; and those who have
acknowledged their animality, bring no stronger proof thereof
than an occasional slight shrinking under the hand, and an
animal smell, which are common to some marine plants.</p>

<p>Whatever be the truth on the subject, these doubtful
opinions prove that they are of the many connecting links
between animals and plants. This is not a proper place to
decide this controversy; I mean merely to make known new
species of this tribe of beings, which I observed last year, on
the shores of Long-Island. Such a fragment will be, perhaps,
the first attempt of the kind; when more species shall be
known, the subject may be investigated with more certainty
and accuracy.</p>

<p>1. <i>Spongia albescens</i>, Raf. (Whitish sponge.) Effuse,
compressed, irregular, perforated, somewhat branched, unequally
lobed, whitish, smooth; lobes truncated; cells porose,
very minute, nearly equal; small unequal cells inside.</p>

<p>Found near Bath and Gravesend, in sandy bottoms. A
large species, sometimes over a foot broad, of quite an irregular
shape, rather flattened, about one inch thick; partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
gibbose; concave now and then, and with large, irregular
openings, as if large branches were anastomosed; circumference
branched or lobed, very jagged, sinus obtuse, lobes
elongated obtuse, truncate or flat, unequally divided. The
substance is entirely of a cinereous white, outside and inside,
of a soft and brittle nature, rather friable; covered outside
with minute pores of an oblong or round shape, and full of
small unequal cells inside.</p>

<p>2. <i>Spongia ostracina</i>, Raf. (Oyster sponge.) Very
branched, erect, red, papillose; branches unequal, often
dichotome, obtuse; cells porose, oblong, nearly equal.</p>

<p>It is often found on the common oyster. (<i>Ostrea virginica.</i>)
It rises from four to six inches, the colour is a fine red, it
branches from the base; the branches are unequal, straight,
cylindrical, or compressed. Substance stupose. Surface
covered with small papilla and small oblong unequal pores.</p>

<p>3. <i>Spongia cespitosa</i>, Raf. (Bushy sponge.) Branched,
cespitose, yellowish, rough, papillose; branches fasciculated,
upright, unequal, flexuose, compressed, slightly anastomosed,
nearly dichotome upwards; cells porose, oblong, nearly equal,
margin lacerated.</p>

<p>Found also on the oyster, but more seldom than the foregoing;
the specimens which I saw was found on the Bluepoint
oysters, by Dr. Eddy. It becomes brown by drying. It rises
from four to six inches, the margin of the cells or pores is
torn into papillar, stiff processes, which produce a rough surface.
Substance stripose. Internal cells oblong, very small.</p>

<p>4. <i>Spongia cladonia.</i> (Cladonian sponge.) Branched effuse,
smooth, pale fulvous, stem procumbent, branches distichal,
one-sided, erect, simple or divided, obtuse; cells porose,
minute; some larger round.</p>

<p>I have found this species at Bath and at Sandy-Hook, on
Sandy bottoms. Length about six inches. Stem and branches
cylindrical or compressed. Substance fibrose, anastomed,
branches divaricate, ascendent, semi dichotomose or simple,
unequal, thicker towards the top.</p>

<p>5. <i>Spongia virgata.</i> (Slender sponge.) Nearly branched,
smooth, fulvous, stem divided, slender, cylindrical, knobby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
branches erect, slender, nearly heads acute; pores unequal,
irregular, small.</p>

<p>A small species, three inches high, found at Oysterbay,
on rocky bottoms, rare; stem with few branches, and imperfect
ones, like knobs. Substance stupose. Branches round,
alternate, small. Pores without any determinate shape.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">P</span>ursh and Michaux mention only one species of American
<i>Xanthium</i>, the <i>X. strumarium</i>, while there are three noticed
in the catalogue of Dr. Muhlenberg, the above species, and the
<i>X. orientale</i>, and <i>X. spinosum</i>. The first and the last are
natives of Europe, and have been naturalized in the United
States, with many other plants. The species called <i>X. orientale</i>
by Dr. Muhlenberg, appears however to be a native; but the <i>X.
orientale</i> of Linnæus, is a native of Siberia, Japan, and the East-Indies;
and when plants are found to grow in such opposite
quarters of the globe, a strong presumption arises that they
are not identical species, which presumption has been confirmed
by experience in many instances, whenever the plants
of both countries have been accurately examined. Decandolle,
in the French Flora, (2d edit, of 1815.) vol. 6. p. 356,
describes, under the name of <i>X. macrocarpon</i>, a species found
in France, and which he takes to be the real <i>X. orientale</i> of
Linnæus. He has changed its name, because, he says, that it
is not certain that the <i>X. orientale</i> grows in Asia; or, if any
grows there, that it is identic with his species; which, however,
is really the <i>X. orientale</i> of Linnæus, Son, Lamark, and
Gaertner. He adds, that he possesses in his herbarium, a
species from Canada, different from his <i>X. macrocarpon</i> which
has been figured by Morison, on whose authority some authors
have asserted that the <i>X. orientale</i> grew in Canada, mistaking
his figure for that plant.</p>

<p>From the above statement, it appears that much obscurity
and difficulty arises in botany, when errors creep into the distinction
of species: to detect those errors, and to ascertain the
synonyme of obscure species, is not one of the least useful
botanical labours. Having found, last year and this year, in
the neighbourhood of New-York, a species of <i>Xanthium</i> different
from any described by the authors, and intermediate between
the <i>X. strumarium</i> and <i>X. orientale</i> of Linnæus, I presume
that it may be the <i>X. orientale</i> of Muhlenberg, Leconte,
and Morison, and the <i>Xanthium</i> of Canada, mentioned by
Decandolle, Dumont, &amp;c. I have given to it the name of
<i>X. maculatum</i>, since the stem is spotted like the <i>Conium maculatum</i>.
None of those authors having described it, I suppose
that its description will be acceptable, and will serve to fix this
new species among the American botanists.</p>

<p>Therefore it will appear, that the <i>X. orientale</i>, which had
been considered as a native of Asia, Europe, and America, is
composed of at least three species; the European species,
which has been called <i>X. macrocarpon</i> by Decandolle, the
American species, which I have called <i>X. maculatum</i>, and the
Asiatic species, to which the name of <i>X. orientale</i> ought to
remain; but which ought to be better described, and more
fully distinguished from the <i>X. macrocarpon</i> by those who may
chance to meet with it. I even suspect that many species
grow in Asia, since that of Ceylon may be different from the
Chinese and Siberian species.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><i>Xanthium Maculatum.</i></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p><em>Definition.</em> Stem flexuous, round, rough, spotted with black;
leaves long-petiolate, cuneate-reniform, nearly trilobe, sinuate-toothed,
obtuse, rough, and thick; fruits elliptic, obtuse muricate;
thorns rough.</p>

<p><em>Description.</em> The root is annual, thick, and white. The
stem rises from one to two feet; it is upright, without thorns,
very thick, and with few branches; it is covered with oblong,
black, and rough spots. The leaves are few, but large,
with very long petiols; they are nearly reniform, with an
acute base, and have three nerves; the teeth are unequal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
large, and obtuse. The flowers and fruits are disposed as in
<i>X. strumarium</i>; but the fruits are generally solitary; they are
half an inch long, nearly cylindrical obtuse, with the two
beaks scarcely perceptible and bent in, covered with short,
thick, and rough thorns, rather soft, and not uncinate. The
whole plant has a peculiar smell, not unpleasant, somewhat
between the camphorate and gravulent odour, but weaker
than in <i>Conysa camphorata</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>History.</em> This plant grows on Long-Island, near the seashore
and marshes. I have found it common near Bath, on
the downs, and in New-Jersey, near Bergen, and Powles Hook,
on the margin of marshy meadows. According to Dr.
Mulenberg, it grows also in Pennsylvania; Messrs. Torrey
and Leconte found it on the island of New-York; and by
Morison and Decandolle's account, it is found as far north as
Canada. It blossoms in August and September, but the fruits
remain on the plant till the severe frosts of December.</p>

<p><em>Observations.</em> This species differs from the <i>X. macrocarpon</i>
of Decandolle, by having smaller fruits, without horns, and
whose thorns are neither hooked nor hispid; by not having
an angular stem, but a round, spotted one, and by its leaves
being broader, and not serrate, &amp;c. Nearly all those differences
exist between it and the <i>X. orientale</i> of Asia, which has
not yet been isolated from the <i>X. macrocarpon</i>. The <i>X. edrinatum</i>
differs from this by having oval fruits, with aggregated,
echinate, and hooked thorns; and the <i>X. strumarium</i>, by having
cordate hirsute leaves, the fruits aggregated, with hooked
thorns and horned tops. The <i>X. spinosum</i>, and <i>X. fruticosum</i>,
ate so totally different that they need not be compared.</p>

Insect that produces the Cut-worm,) communicated for

Brace</span>, <em>of Litchfield, Conn.</em></p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>his moth, whose larva is one of our most destructive enemies,
belongs to the Linnæan family noctua, in the genus phalaena.
Its specific characters are as follow: Wings incumbent
and horizontal, when at rest; body long and thin; thorax
thick, but not crested; head small; eyes prominent and
black; antennæ setacious, gradually lessening towards extremities,
and slightly ciliated; palpi two, flat, broad in the middle,
and very hairy; tongue rolled up between them, not very
prominent; clypeus small, legs long, small and hairy; wings
long as body; under wings shortest; colour a dark silvery
gray, with transverse dotted bands of black on upper wings.
The insect lays its eggs in the commencement of autumn, at
the roots of trees and near the ground: they are hatched early
in May. The habits of the cut-worm have been often and
fully detailed. They eat almost all kinds of vegetables, preferring
beans, cabbages, and corn. They continue in this
state about four weeks; they then cast their skin and enter
the <em>pupa</em> state, under ground. This is a crustaceous covering,
fitted to the parts of the future insect. In this they continue
for four weeks longer, and come out in the fly, or insect
state, about the middle of July. All those chrysalids that I
exposed to the sun, died; and all those that were kept cool
under earth, produced an insect: hence I infer, that the heat
of the sun will kill the chrysalids. If, then, the ground be
ploughed about the first of July, many of those insects might
be destroyed, and the destruction of the productions of the
next year prevented; for the <em>pupa</em> is never more than a few
inches under ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The phalaena devastator is never seen during the day; it
conceals itself in the crevices of buildings, and beneath the
bark of trees. About sun-down it leaves its hiding-place, is
constantly on the wing, and very troublesome about the candles
in houses. It flies very rapidly, and is not easily taken.</p>

<p>Such is the description of this formidable enemy to vegetation.
No efficacious method has yet been taken to prevent its
ravages, but the one who could accomplish it, would do the
cause of agriculture an essential service.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">M</span>r. Lesueur has published, in the 5th Number of the
Journal of the Academy of Sciences of Philadelphia, for September,
1817, the description of a new fish, which he calls
<i>Cyprinus maxillingua</i>: he considers it as a very singular and
anomalous species, owing to the peculiar structure of its lobed
lower jaw and tongue, which is external, and situated as an
appendage to the former. It was discovered in Pipe-creek,
Maryland, in June, 1816, by said author, who confesses that
he does not consider it as properly belonging to the genus
<i>Cyprinus</i>, and presumes that when other species shall be discovered,
possessing the same character, they will constitute a
separate genus. Although this principle and presumption is
correct, it was wrong to delay the formation of such a distinct
genus, because only a species was then known, since so many
genera are composed of single species. However, Mr. Lesueur's
expectation was verified even before he wrote it, since
in May, 1817, I had discovered in the Fishkill, State of New-York,
another, species, evidently congenerous with the <i>Cyprinus
maxillingua</i>, having the same structure of the mouth, &amp;c.

species, having no doubt that many more will hereafter be
added to it by accurate observers, and I give to it the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>

<p class="p1 center"><em>To Professor Silliman.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="fs200">T</span>he successful employment of the steam-engine, in navigating
the rivers and inland waters of the United States, and
the probable extension of this mode of conveyance of persons
and property, makes those improvements desirable which
adapt the steam-engine to this purpose with less complication
and expense, placing it more within reach of individual enterprise,
and rendering it even useful on our small rivers and
canals.</p>

<p>The steam-engine, though often seen in operation, is not
readily understood by an observer, without an acquaintance
with the facts in natural philosophy on which its power depends:
and it may elucidate the subject of this communication
to advert, for a moment, to the gradations by which this important
machine has attained its present perfection.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that as early as 1663, the Marquis of
Worcester published some obscure hints of a mechanical power
derived from the elastic force of steam.</p>

<p>In 1669, Savary, availing himself of the suggestion, and pursuing
the subject more scientifically, invented his engine, consisting
of an apparatus to cause a vacuum by the condensation
of steam, so that the water to be raised would thereupon, by
the external weight of the atmosphere, rise into the chamber
of the apparatus, which the steam had occupied.</p>

<p>As caloric becomes latent in the steam which it forms at 212° of
Fahrenheit, and the steam thus formed occupies 1800 times the
bulk of the water composing it; and as it returns instantly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a state of water on losing its heat, by contact with any thing
cold, Savary easily produced his vacuum by the injection of a
little cold water.</p>

<p>He also used (though in a very disadvantageous manner)
the expansive force of steam to drive the water out of the
chamber, through a pipe different from that by which it
entered.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether this kind of engine was ever erected
on a scale of any magnitude; for, a few years later, Newcomen
and Crawley invented the first engine with a cylinder and
piston; and Savary, abandoning his own, united with them in
bringing their engine into use.</p>

<p>As steam drives out air, the principle of this engine was to
let steam into the cylinder beneath the piston, where (the piston
having risen to the top of the cylinder) a jet of cold water<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
condensed the steam, produced a vacuum, and the piston,
working air tight, descended by the pressure of the atmosphere
upon it, this pressure being a weight of nearly fifteen
pounds to each square inch; so that if the cylinder were two
feet diameter, it would amount to a weight of three tons.</p>

<p>This mode of operation prevailed for about fifty years, and
though much used to pump water from mines, was found to
have great inconveniences and defects; till, in the year 1762,
Mr. Watt, being employed to repair a working-model of an
engine at the University of Glasgow, was led to direct his
mind to the improvement of the machine; and from his experiments
sprung the most essential change, viz. the condensation
of the steam in the cylinder, by opening a communication
with a separate vessel, into which the injection of cold water
was made, thus allowing the cylinder to remain hot.</p>

<p>On opening that communication, the steam instantly rushes
to the cold, or rather is destroyed by the instant loss or reduction
of its heat, and the vacuum thus made allows the piston
to descend as before mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Watt soon added the airpump to the condenser, to extract
the air extricated from the water in boiling, together
with the water injected.</p>

<p>The next step was to close the upper end of the cylinder,
the piston-rod working through a tight packing to exclude the
air, letting the steam in above, as well as below the piston, by
an alternate communication, and then condensing it in both
cases alternately, thus producing a double stroke; at the same
time deriving some aid from the expansive force of the steam
on the side of the piston opposite to the vacuum. This is
essentially the form of all the engines in use at the present
day. The minor parts devised by Mr. Watt, as the working
of the valves, &amp;c. were such as would readily occur to a scientific
mechanician.</p>

<p>While he was bringing the engine to its present perfection,
and furnishing it for the numerous mines, manufactories, and
breweries in Great Britain, variations were devised by Cartwright,
by Hornblower, Woolf, and others in England, and
more recently by Evans and by Ogden in America, evincing
much ingenuity, but (with the exception of Evans's, which is
a simple engine of high pressure) making the machine more
complex.</p>

<p>Watt and Bolton's engine, as most generally used, being
properly an atmospheric engine, or working with steam so low
as merely to produce a vacuum in the cylinder, became of
enormous dimensions, when the power required was that of
an hundred horses: a scale of estimate adapted to the comprehension
of those who had before used the labour of that
animal, and preferred to substitute the steam-engine.</p>

<p>It had not, however, escaped the notice of Mr. Watt, that
there existed in steam another source of power besides that of
atmospheric pressure. The experiments of his learned friend,
Dr. Black, of Glasgow, as well as those of the French chemists,
and of Papin, in the instance of his digester, had ascertained
the laws of its expansive force, and amongst other interesting
facts, those subservient to our present purpose; viz. That
after water has reached the boiling point, 212° of Fahrenheit,
the caloric which enters it no longer becomes latent, but sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>sible
in the steam, which thereupon acquires expansive force
to an unlimited degree: that this force increases geometrically;
or, that every accession of about 30° of heat, nearly
doubles its power at those stages of progression; that when
the pressure at a high temperature is taken off, or the steam
allowed to flow, there is an instantaneous and rapid production
of steam; a fact which proves there can be no necessity of a
large space for the steam to form in above the water, provided
it be sufficient to prevent water from issuing with the steam,
and, therefore, that boilers of a small cylindrical form are best.</p>

<p>It may be a fair question, why Mr. Watt did not further
employ this principle of expansive force? We may readily
conceive of several motives to the contrary. Watt and Bolton's
engines were in great demand; they gave entire satisfaction,
and the work they performed saved so much labour as to
afford the purchase at a high price. The public had gained
immensely by this better form of the engine, and Mr. Watt
enjoyed the benefits of the patent he had obtained; and, at a
later period, this preference was increased by an accident which
happened to Trevethick's engine, though caused by gross mismanagement,
that would have been equally fatal to any other.</p>

<p>From an investigation, by a committee of parliament, into
the causes of the several fatal explosions of steam-engine
boilers within a few years, published in Tillock's Magazine,
vol. 1., it appears that in every instance the accident was fairly
attributable to neglect or mismanagement. Many competent
persons were summoned to give their opinions; and through
the contrariety of their testimony, the prevalent opinion appears
to have been, that cast-iron boilers cannot be safe; that
as many engines of high steam as of low are now used in England,
but that the high are much the most economical in fuel
and cost; that they are more safe, if properly constructed; it
being argued by some, that boilers for steam of 100 pounds to
the inch, are easily made of strength to sustain 500 pounds;
this excess being much greater than in those constructed for
low steam, makes them comparatively the safest, as the safety
valves are less liable to be accidentally prevented from venting
the steam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>In the United States, instances are not wanting of the successful
operation of high steam; of which the engine at the
mint is a conspicuous example. There can, indeed, be no
good reason why this great power should not be employed to
an extent within the limits of safety, if more economical and
convenient. If boilers can bear (as they are usually made of
iron) 500 pounds, there can be no danger in using them with
fifty; and this gives an increase of power, with a condenser,
fourfold, or makes a ten horse power forty. The economy,
therefore, of high steam, hardly admits of a question. It
seems unphilosophical to neglect a power so great, merely
because it is so.</p>

<p>Mr. Watt was desirous of an improvement by which to
obtain a direct rotatory motion. His experiments, resembling
those of Curtis, at New-York, were not found permanently
practicable.</p>

<p>It was probably perceived to be a great object to get rid of
a reciprocating movement of large masses, on the well-known
mechanical principle, that it consumes power to check momentum,
as well as to give it&mdash;to drag an inert mass into
motion rapidly, in opposite directions. And in engines for
navigation this is more disadvantageous than for land uses, as
the foundation of the engine cannot be perfectly substantial.</p>

<p>An engine, therefore, that possesses the cylinder and other
members of Watt's engine, working with or without a condenser,
at pleasure&mdash;having a rotatory movement&mdash;requiring no
ponderous balance-wheel&mdash;adapted to high steam&mdash;attended by
no inconvenience from the rapidity of its stroke or movement&mdash;having
no inert mass of machinery to move reciprocally&mdash;more
powerful, proportionately, from its using steam
as strong as that in the boiler&mdash;of a simple and durable construction,
and by a combination of two similar machines attached
to the same common intermediate axis, operating so as
to give nearly an equal power at every moment of its operation,
seems to combine every thing desirable in an engine for
the purposes of navigation. Such appears to be the revolving
engine invented by Mr. Morey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>When those who are acquainted with steam-engines of the
atmospheric kind only, are told that Morels cylinder revolves,
their imaginations may suppose a moving mass as large as the
enormous cylinders they have been accustomed to see: but it
is not so; the elastic force of steam requires machinery but of
comparatively small dimensions.</p>

<p>The revolving engine makes up in activity what in other
engines is supplied by magnitude.</p>

<p>We will take for example the engine working at the glass
manufactory, in this vicinity, the cylinder of which has one
foot stroke and nine inches diameter, and is at least a ten horse
power, working with fifty pounds&mdash;or, the engine now building
for the Hartford boat. This engine will have two cylinders
of seventeen inches diameter and eighteen inch stroke;
they will revolve fifty times a minute. The area of the piston
in each being 227 inches, steam at fifty pounds will give an
hundred horse power.</p>

<p>This boat is seventy-seven feet long, twenty-one feet wide,
and measures one hundred and thirty-six tons. The engine, with
its boilers, will occupy sixteen feet by twelve, or one-eighth
only of the boat; the cylinders being hung on the timbers of
the deck over the boilers. She is principally intended to tow
vessels up the river to Hartford.</p>

<p>In towing, it is of importance that the engine admit of any
inferior velocity or power, till some momentum is had. An
engine working by atmospheric pressure does not admit of this.
And as the boat herself, at the moment of commencing the
operation, may have no steerage-way, by placing two blade-rudders
at the sides, behind the water-wheel, where a current
is occasioned by them, the boat is kept in her relative position.</p>

<p>The application of the steam-engine to the towing of other
vessels was fully appreciated by the late Mr. Fulton, whose
conspicuous labours and enterprise, in the establishment of
steam-boats, the public duly honours. His active mind had
conceived of its utility; and he would have obtained a patent,
had not the previous employment of steam in this way, and
the award of arbitrators on the question been in my favour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which I mention merely in reference to the supposed utility
of this mode of operation, in connexion with Morey's engine.</p>

<p>Morey's engine should rather be denominated a revolving
engine than a rotatory one, especially as it is essentially different
from one so called invented by Mr. Curtis.</p>

The frame, holding the cylinder (<em>d</em>) is, by its opposite sides,
so hung as to revolve. To the end of the axis of one side,
extended over the cylinder, is fixed the centre-piece (<em>h</em>)
resembling a crank, from which the bar or pitman (<em>f</em>) communicates
to the cross-piece of the piston-rod. On this same
axis, but outside the frame, is placed two circular pieces, one
of brass, the other of iron, (<em>k</em>) which we may call the valves.
One is fixed on the axis, the other moves, and accompanies
the frame and cylinder in its revolution; from it, at opposite
sides, pipes lead the steam to each end of the cylinder. It
has a smooth face, which applies, and is kept by springs close
to that of its counterpart fixed on the said axis. Steam-pipes
lead from the boilers through the counterpart into the moving
valve. On the opposite side of the fixed piece the eduction-pipe
(<em>o o</em>) leads to the condensers.</p>

<p>The condensers (<em>p</em>) are upright vessels, two to each cylinder,
connected at top by a sliding valve box, so that the steam
enters them alternately. At bottom are two valves, kept
closed by weights. A stream of water is injected into the
condensers, which escapes by the bottom valves (<em>p p</em>) by

on bearings. This axis (<em>i i</em>) may be of any length; may terminate
in a crank or cog-wheel, or another cylinder (as here
represented) may be attached thereto at right angles to the

<p>The supply of water to the boilers is either by a pump, in
usual form, or by the <em>supply-chamber</em> of my invention, (<a href="#N2-Plate_III">Plate
III. Fig. 2</a>.) which consists simply of a pipe having two stop-cocks,
one end in a reservoir, the other opening into the
boiler at top, sloping downward for a foot or two. The cocks
are in the sloping point. The operation commences, by
opening the cock nearest the boiler, the steam drives the air
out of the pipe through the water into the reservoir; shut
the cock, and the water rises from the reservoir to fill it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shut the second cock, and open the first, the water discharges
from the chamber into the boiler; repeated by a movement
from the engine, when in motion, the supply continues with
more certainty than by a pump, because it is difficult to pump
hot water, on account of the elasticity of the steam arising
from it, which obstructs the operation of the valves. And it
is important not to have to pump against the pressure of high
steam.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<em>d</em>, <em>e</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To this engine is conveniently applied the gas-fire, in the
following manner.</p>

<p>The boilers being cylindrical, with an inside flue for fuel,
two or three are placed close together, and set in the following
manner: First, cross-bars of iron are laid on the timbers, a
platform of sheet-iron is laid on these bars, coated over with
clay mortar, or cemented, to keep out the air. Upon the
sheet-iron, and over the bars below, are placed cast-iron
blocks in shape to fit the curve of the boiler, so as to raise it
three or four inches above the platform. The sheet-iron is
continued up the outsides of the outer boilers, so as to
enclose them; and at one end, between the boilers, there are
small grates for coal or other fuel.</p>

<p>The tar vessel or vessels, as the case may be, are lodged
in the space between and upon the boilers, and a small fire
may be made under them, if necessary. A pipe leads steam
in at one end, two pipes at the other; one near the bottom,
and one near the top, lead out the tar and steam. These
pipes unite below; the steam and tar, thus mingled in suitable
proportions, flow to the main fire, or the flues of the boilers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as well as to the coal-fire below, where the gas and tar are
ignited. The fireman judges of the proportion of each, by
the effect; the object being to produce a nearly white flame
without appearance of tar. Thus flame is applied to the
greatest possible surface, and the apparatus adds very little to
the cost of the engine.</p>

<p>There are also two improvements in the boiler, which I
deem it important to mention. First, the lining or covering
of the flue within with sheet-iron or copper, <em>perforated with
small holes</em>, reaching down its sides, nearly to the bottom.
<a href="#N2-Plate_III">Plate III. Fig. 2</a>. <em>a</em> the boiler; <em>b</em> the flue; <em>d</em> the grate;
<em>c c</em> the lining.</p>

<p>This causes the water to circulate rapidly between them to
the top of the flue, and protects it from being run dry, or
heated red hot, when the water gets, by accident, too low.
The lining also <em>causes the steam to form much faster, in consequence
of this circulation</em>.</p>

<p>The other is the interior boiler. A vessel occupying the
back part of the flue. <a href="#N2-Plate_II">Plate II. Fig. 8</a>. (<em>d</em>) communicating
downwards with the water, and upwards with the steam of the
main boiler. The fire acts upon it very forcibly, surrounding
it on all sides.</p>

<p>I have said there is no reciprocating movement in Morey's
engine. Should it be objected that the piston moves in the
cylinder as usual, it must be apparent that it also moves circularly;
it is in fact the cylinder that moves, carrying the
piston with it, which gives and keeps up the motion, by
drawing and pressing on the centre-piece, and communicating
the resistance thence to the <em>guides</em> of the cross-piece on the
insides of the frame, which thus receives its motion.</p>

<p>In fact, this form of the engine seems divested of all the
usual drawbacks on its power, and leaves it to act freely with
any velocity, according to the strength of the steam in the
boilers.</p>

<p>Such it appears in principle, and such thus far in practise.
I have therefore preferred it for the purposes of navigation,
and have purchased the patent right. But, though interested
to recommend it, I cannot expect it to be preferred by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
intelligent, if there is not merit in the invention, and great
economy in its use. It may be considered the most direct
application of the power, and the most unexceptionable mode
of using the expansive force of high steam. And from the
nature of its movement the most applicable to boats and
vessels.</p>

<p>Your Journal being the intended medium of information to
promote the useful arts, I hope it may be consistent with this
object to explain the manner in which these improvements
may be made extensively useful.</p>

<p>It being necessary to supply the engines at a reasonable
rate, I have established a manufactory for this kind only.
The great expense of steam-boats hitherto, has confined their
use too exclusively to the accommodation of passengers.
There is a wide field opening for their use, in freighting, on
all our waters; and it is often of importance to a community,
when great savings can be made, that large capitalists should be
induced to engage that such savings may be greater. Where
companies are formed for an extensive operation, the legislature
may, with propriety, grant an extension of the time for
patents to run, that such persons may be duly remunerated
for their enterprise, by the duration of the service.</p>

<p>Our laws do not yet make a proper distinction between
patents of a large and expensive kind and those requiring little
or no capital to go into operation. The period of fourteen
years remunerates the inventor of those improvements only
that require no capital, and involve no risk.</p>

<p>On this ground several of the State legislatures have, with
good policy, given encouragement to this kind of enterprise.
They suspend the free use of the invention a few years,
rather than loose its immediate operation on a large scale of
public benefit.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of the measure plainly appears by its
not interfering with the laws of the United States. It is not
an act exclusive of, or in opposition to, patents, but acknowledging
and confirming them. It is furthering and giving
effect to the intentions of the general government, in the
encouragement of useful inventions. For their own particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
section of the union, a State legislature may thus provide for
the protection of capital, engaged in enterprise of uncommon
risk, as well as of uncommon usefulness, without excluding
other and better inventions, should they arise.</p>

<p>I shall ask leave to communicate, for some future Number,
the results of experiments, now making, with the gas fire
applied to engines.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XVI.</span> &nbsp; <em>Cautions regarding Fulminating Powders.</em></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Fulminating Mercury.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">D</span>uring a late lecture in the laboratory of Yale College, a
quantity of fulminating mercury, probably about 100 or 150
grains, lay upon a paper, the paper lay on a small stool,
which was made of pine plank, <em>one inch and a half thick</em>; a
glass gas receiver, 5 or 6 quarts capacity, stood over the
powder, as a guard, but without touching it, and stool and all
stood on one of the shelves of the pneumatic cistern, surrounded
by tall tubes and other glasses, several of which
were within 6 or 8 inches. A small quantity of the fulminating
powder, at the distance of a few feet, was merely
flashed, by a coal of fire, but without explosion. In a manner,
not easily understood, the whole quantity of powder
under the large glass instantly exploded with an astounding
report; <em>but the glass was not exploded</em>&mdash;it was merely thrown
up a little; in its fall it was shattered, and broke a glass which
it hit, but no fragment was <em>projected</em>, and none of the other
contiguous tubes and glasses were even overset, nor were any
of a large audience, and some of them very near, even
scratched; <em>but the plank, one and a half inch thick, on which
the powder lay, had a hole blown quite through, almost as large
as the palm of one's hand</em>. This is a striking instance to prove
that the <em>initial</em> force of this powder, when exploded, is very
great, but that it extends but a very little way. If it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
strewed through a glass tube of three-fourths of an inch in
diameter, and exploded by a coal of fire or hot iron, the tube
may be held in the naked hand, and the powder only flashes
without breaking the tube, and merely coats it over inside,
and that very prettily, with the revived quicksilver.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Fulminating Silver.</em></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>Chemists are too well acquainted with the tremendous
energy of this preparation, to make any comment upon its
powers necessary. Unhappily, however, it is now made a
subject of amusement; it is prepared for sale by those who
know nothing of it, except as a nostrum, and it is bought by
others who have not even this degree of knowledge. It is
true it is put up in small quantities, in the little toys called
torpedoes, and, if exploded one by one, they will ordinarily
do no harm; but as they fall into the hands of children, we
can never be secure that they will be discreetly used.</p>

<p>A very severe accident, from the unexpected explosion of
this substance, occurred some years since in the laboratory of
Yale College. (See Bruce's Journal, Vol. I. p. 163.) And,
notwithstanding that this occurrence was well known in New-Haven,
the same accident, only under a severer form, has
again occurred in that town.</p>

<p>A man who had bought the secret of making fulminating
silver, had prepared as much as resulted from the solution of
one ounce and a half. Apparently, in a great measure, unaware
of the nature of the preparation, he had placed it, unmixed
with any thing, on an earthen plate, which stood on a table;
his wife and children being around, he sat down to distribute
the powder upon several papers which he had prepared for
the purpose; sand and shot are mixed with the powder in the
papers for the purpose of giving momentum, and of producing
attrition when the torpedo is thrown, in order to ensure its
explosion. Probably also the sand, looking not very unlike
the powder, may be intended to screen it from view, and thus
to preserve the secret, should the papers be opened. The
unhappy man no sooner touched the fulminating silver with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
knife, than it exploded with its usual violence; the table was
split in two; blood issued copiously from every part of his
face, not from wounds, for it does not appear that the fragments
hit him, but, according to the opinion of a competent
judge, the blood was actually forced through the pores of the
skin by the power of the explosion, which very nearly destroyed
his eyes. He suffered immensely, but now, at the
end of eight months, sees partially with one eye, but the
other is nearly, if not quite, destroyed.</p>

<p>Should not the tampering with such dangerous substances
by ignorant people be prevented by law?</p>

<p>In a late lecture in the laboratory of Yale College, some
fulminating silver, on the point of a knife, was in the act of
being put upon a copper-plate connected with one pole of a
galvanic battery in active operation, the other pole was not
touched by the experimenter; but it seems that the influence
which was communicated through the floor of the room was
sufficient instantly to explode the powder, as soon as the knife
touched the copper-plate; the knifeblade was broken in two,
and one half of it thrown to a distance among the audience.</p>

<p>Recently also, we are informed, in one of the foreign journals,
that a man in England, who accidentally trod on a quantity
of fulminating silver, had his foot nearly destroyed by the
explosion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. XIX.</span> &nbsp; <em>Account of an economical method of obtaining
Gelatine from bones, as practised in Paris. Communicated
to the Editor by Mr.</em> <span class="smcap">Isaac Doolittle</span>.</p>


<p class="right"><em>Paris, 16th May, 1818.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">My dear Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="fs200">A</span> few days since I visited the very interesting establishment
of M. Robert, for the extraction of the gelatinous matter
from bones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The bones used for this purpose are those only which
answered no useful purpose (except for the fabrication of
phosphorus or ammoniac) before this discovery, such as those
of the head, the ribs, &amp;c. &amp;c., the legs of sheep and calves, &amp;c.
Those formerly used by <em>toysmen</em> (<em>Tabletiers</em>) are still used for
that purpose, after extracting so much of the gelatine as can
be done by ebullition.</p>

<p>When the heads of oxen are to be operated upon, they
begin by extracting the teeth, (these are reserved for the
fabrication of ammoniac, as affording a greater proportion of
that alkali than any of the other bones,) they then break the
skull, in such manner as to preserve all the compact parts in
as regular forms as possible; these pieces present a surface
of 20 to 30 square inches, and are put to soak in a mixture of
muriatic acid and water. The muriatic acid used bears about
twenty-three degrees o£ the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aeromètre</i>, and is diluted by
water to about six degrees&mdash;four parts of the liquor is used to
one part of bones. They are left in this state, in open vessels,
until a complete solution of the phosphate of lime has
taken place, and the gelatinous part of the bone remains in
its original shape and size, and is perfectly supple. When
this operation is finished, which commonly lasts six or eight
days, the gelatine is put into baskets, being first drained, and
immersed a short time in boiling water, in order to extract
any small remains of grease, which would deteriorate the
gelatine, and also to extract any of the acid which might be
lodged in the pores. It is then carefully wiped with clean
linen, and afterward washed in copious streams of cold water,
to whiten it, and render it more transparent; it is then put to
dry in the shade.</p>

<p>Two ounces of this gelatine are said to be equal to three
pounds of beef in making soup&mdash;that is, three pounds of beef and
two ounces of gelatine will make as much soup, and of as good
quality, as six pounds of beef. It is constantly used in some of
the hospitals of the capital, particularly in the lying-in-hospital.</p>

<p>The ends of the bones, and such parts as from their porosity
might still retain a portion of the acid, are separated, and used
for making glue of a very superior quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The inside of the bones of sheep's legs furnish a sort of
membranous glue, which supplies, with advantage, the place
of isinglass in the fabrication of silk stuffs.</p>

<p>I give you these particulars, not because I think they contain
any thing new to you, <em>in principle</em>, but because I may have
hit upon some <em>details</em> with which you were unacquainted.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>n consequence of the great want of good fresh water in
many of the maritime parts of France, the government some
time since ordered some experiments to be made, upon an extensive
scale, in order to ascertain how far seawater, when
distilled, could be used with success. Little or no use had
hitherto been made of water so prepared, except in long voyages,
and chiefly then only as a matter of necessity. There
are above two hundred leagues of seacoast in France, where,
to the breadth of many miles, the inhabitants are compelled to
make use of bad and impure water, which, in many cases, is
injurious to the health of themselves and their animals. In
similar cases, it was the custom of the ancients to construct
cisterns; but these are not only expensive in themselves, but
their utility depends upon the quantity of rain that falls; while
upon the shores of the most barren places, nature has supplied
a variety of vegetable matter, which, when dried, would
not only serve as a fuel for the purposes of distillation, but
from the ashes of which might be obtained a saline substance,
sufficient to repay the expense of collecting, drying, and burning.
Thus the fuel for the distillation of seawater would, in
reality, cost nothing, while its preparation would employ many
individuals, particularly women and children. Before, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
erecting any apparatus for this purpose, it was necessary
to ascertain both the utility and salubrity of the water
thus prepared.</p>

<p>It is well known that Bougainville, Phipps, Homelin, &amp;c.
had employed this water with much success; but they, like
most of the chemists of the last age, did not endeavour to imitate
the process of nature in all its simplicity, but mixed
various substances with the seawater, in order to take away
or lessen the effect of the empyreuma arising from the distillation,
and which was so unpleasant to the smell and taste.
And it is this which in general renders sailors so averse to it,
and excites a prejudice very unfavourable to the salubrity of
distilled seawater. One of the great objects to be ascertained
was, whether this disagreeable smell and taste was peculiar to
seawater or arose from the act of distillation.</p>

<p>In the month of July, last year, the king ordered some experiments
to be made, upon a large scale, at the three ports of
Brest, Rochefort, and Toulon. The instructions given were
as follows: That a sufficient quantity of seawater should be
distilled to prepare, for the space of a month, bread and other
food for a certain number of criminals, who were employed
on the works of these ports, and also to supply them with
drink, keeping from them during that period every other
liquid. Ten or twelve persons at each part voluntarily came
forward and offered themselves for the experiment.</p>

<p>The persons employed by government first distilled a sufficient
quantity of seawater, without the admixture of any other
substance. This produce dissolved soap, dressed vegetables,
produced the same appearances, with the aerometer, as that
distilled from spring water. There was no difference between
the one and the other. But the distilled seawater had always
that empyreumatic taste and smell, of which we have before
spoken; and it was so strong, that the commission at Toulon
called it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">odeur de marine</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">odeur de marecage</i>. But this is
not peculiar to seawater, for the result of a distillation of fresh
water had always the same taste and smell. Neither of these
liquids immediately loses this by being filtered through char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>coal;
but by being exposed for some time to the air, the distilled
seawater loses this unpleasant quality, and then it does
not differ from fresh water derived from the purest source;
and both have equally stood every chemical test to which they
have been exposed. The chemical properties of this water
having thus been determined, it remains to give an account of
the effects upon the individuals who underwent the experiment.
These are the principal results:</p>

<p><em>Brest.</em> During the first days, those who drank the water
complained of a weight upon the stomach. This indisposition,
which was the only one they experienced, soon decreased
upon taking exercise, and totally went off by an additional
ounce of biscuit added to their common ration. One of them,
on the 29th day, had a few symptoms, but which he himself
attributed to an indigestion, from some bacon he had eaten.
Eight individuals drank twenty-five pints a day, rather more
than three pints each,&mdash;(N. B. The French pint contains
very near fifty-seven cubic inches of English measure, and is
the regulation size for the claret or Bordeaux bottle; but in
general the bottles are rather smaller. The French pint is
therefore equal to rather more than nineteen-twentieths of an
English quart, wine measure.)</p>

<p><em>Toulon.</em> The results obtained at the arsenal of this town,
were not less decisive or satisfactory. The six persons who
made the experiment acquired a greater degree of freshness
in their appearance, and were much fatter. Their daily consumption
of distilled water was nine pounds (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poids de marc</i>)
for drink, and eleven pounds for cooking. This is nearly the
same relative quantity as those at Brest.</p>

<p><em>Rochefort.</em> The experiments here have not been made
with the same regularity; because the fifteen persons fixed
upon had all agreed to say that they were very ill. The two
principal ones complained of violent cholics and diarrhœas:
but the plot was discovered, and upon being put upon the sick-list,
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la diète</i>,) they were laughed at by their companions.
No one of them was really indisposed; on the contrary, many
thought they experienced some good effect in regard to some
infirmities under which they had long laboured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The above are not, however, the only experiments which
have been made upon this beverage. Several persons wishing
to ascertain its effects by individual experience, have
voluntarily confined themselves to its use; and the members
of the commission of inquiry are almost in the daily practice
of taking it. The captain of the Duclat has taken it every day
at his meals for twenty days, and has experienced not the
smallest inconvenience from its use. M. M. Vasse, and Chatelain,
apothecaries to the marine at Brest, have occasionally
kept the water in their mouths for four hours, by constantly
renewing it, and have not found either the sharp taste, or
other caustic qualities, which have been said to be peculiar to
it. And here it may be proper to state, that the mouths of all
the individuals who had taken the water for a length of time
were examined, without the detection of any thing in them
either of a swollen or inflammatory appearance. Such are the
reports of commissioners employed to investigate the effects
of distilled seawater, who, although separated at a great distance
from each other, and having no communication, all agree
in the inference, that it may be employed without any injury
to the health, both as a beverage and in cookery, for the space
of at least a month; and the fair presumption is, that it may be
employed for a much longer time; and that in consequence,
it must be considered as a very happy resource in long voyages
of discovery.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition V.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>To determine that position of any degree in the scale, which
will render all the concords terminated by it, at a medium,
the most harmonious; supposing their relative
frequency given, and all the other degrees fixed.</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he best scheme of temperament for the changeable scale,
on supposition that all the concords were of equally frequent
occurrence, is investigated in Prop. III. But it is shown, in
the last Proposition, that some chords occur in practice far
more frequently than others. Hence it becomes necessary to
ascertain what changes in the scale above referred to, this
different frequency requires. Any given degree, as C, terminates
six different concords; a Vth, IIId, and 3d above, and
the same intervals below it. Let the numbers denoting the
frequency of these chords below C be denoted by <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>,
and their temperaments, before the position of C is changed,
by <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and <i>p</i>: and let the frequency of the chords above C
be denoted by <i>a′</i>, <i>b′</i>, and <i>c′</i>, and their temperaments by <i>m′</i>, <i>n′</i>,
and <i>p′</i>, respectively. If, now, we regard any two of these 6
chords, whose temperaments would be diminished by moving
C opposite ways, and of which the sum of the temperaments is
consequently fixed, it is manifest that the more frequent the
occurrence, the less ought to be the temperament. Were
we guided <em>only</em> by the consideration of making the aggregate
of dissonance heard in them in a given time, the least possible,
we should make the one of most frequent occurrence perfect,
and throw the whole of the temperament upon the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Let, for example, <i>a</i> be greater than <i>a′</i>, and let <i>x</i> be any
variable distance to which C is moved, so as to diminish the
temperament <i>m</i>, of the chord whose frequency is expressed
by <i>a</i>. Then the temperament of <i>a</i> will become <span class="nowrap">= <i>m</i> ~ <i>x</i>,</span> and
that of <i>a′</i> <span class="nowrap">= <i>m′</i> + <i>x</i>.</span> Hence, as the dissonance head in each, in
a given time, is in the compound ratio of its frequency of occurrence
and its temperament, their aggregate dissonance will
be as <span class="nowrap"><i>a</i> · <span class="over"><i>m</i> ~ <i>x</i></span> + <i>a′</i> · <span class="over"><i>m′</i> + <i>x</i></span>;</span> a quantity which, as <i>a</i> is supposed
greater than <i>a′</i>, evidently becomes a minimum when <i>x</i> = <i>m</i>,
or the chord, whose frequency is <i>a</i>, is made perfect. But
in this way we render the harmony of the chords very unequal,
which is, cæteris paribus, a disadvantage. As these
considerations are heterogeneous, it must be a matter of
judgment, rather than of mathematical certainty, what precise
weight is to be given to each. We will give so much
weight to the latter consideration, as to make the temperament
of each concord <em>inversely as its frequency</em>. We have then<br />

<span class="nowrap">
<i>a</i> : <i>a′</i> ::

<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over"><i>m</i> &ndash; <i>x</i></span>
</span>&nbsp; :

<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over"><i>m′</i> + <i>x</i></span>
</span>&nbsp;;
</span>

which gives &nbsp;

<span class="nowrap">
x =

<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka"><i>am</i> &ndash; <i>a′m′</i></span>
  <span class="blka over">&nbsp; <i>a</i> + <i>a′</i> &nbsp; </span>
</span>&nbsp;.
</span>
</p>

<p>But there are six concords to be accommodated, instead of
two; and it is evident that all the pairs cannot have their
temperament inversely as their frequency, since the numbers
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, &amp;c. and <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, &amp;c. have no constant ratio to each
other. This, however, will be the case, at a medium, if
<i>x</i> be made such, that the <em>sum</em> of the products of the numbers
expressing the frequency of those chords whose temperaments
are increased by <i>x</i>, into their respective temperaments, shall
be equal to the sum of the corresponding products belonging
to those chords whose temperaments are diminished by <i>x</i>.
Applying this principle to the system of temperament in Prop.
III, which flattens all the concords, it is plain that raising any
given degree by <i>x</i> will increase the temperaments of the
concords above that degree, and diminish those of the concords
below it. Hence it ought to be raised till

<span class="nowrap">
(<i>m</i> &ndash; <i>x</i>) <i>a</i> +(<i>n</i> &ndash; <i>x</i>)<i>b</i> + (<i>p</i> &ndash; <i>x</i>)<i>c</i> =
</span>

<span class="nowrap">
(<i>m′</i> + <i>x</i>)<i>a</i> + (<i>n′</i> + <i>x</i>)<i>b′</i> + (<i>p</i> + <i>x</i>)<i>c′</i> ;
</span>

from which <i>x</i> is found

<span class="nowrap">
=
<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka"><i>am</i> &ndash; <i>a′m′</i> + <i>bn</i> &ndash; <i>b′n′</i> + <i>cp</i> &ndash; <i>c′p′</i></span>
  <span class="blka over">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>a</i> + <i>a′</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>b′</i> + <i>c</i> + <i>c′</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>
Should either of the temperaments be sharp, the sign of that term of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the numerator, in which it occurs, must be changed; and
should the total value of the expression be negative, <i>x</i> must
be taken below C.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition VI.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>To determine that system of temperaments for the concords
of the changeable scale, which will render it, including
every consideration, the most harmonious possible.</p></div>

<p>We can scarcely expect to find any direct analytical process,
which will furnish us with a solution of this complicated
problem, at a single operation. We shall therefore content
ourselves with a method which gradually approximates towards
the desired results. The best position of any given degree,
as C, supposing all the rest fixed, is determined by the last
proposition. In the same manner it is evident that the constitution
of the whole scale will be the best possible, when no
degree in it can be elevated or depressed, without rendering
the sums of the products there referred to, unequal. We can
approximate to this state of the scale, by applying the theorem
in Prop. V. to each of the degrees successively. It is not
essential in what order the application is made; but for the
sake of uniformity, in the successive approximations, we will
begin with that degree which has the greatest sum <i>a</i> + <i>a′</i> + <i>b</i> +
&amp;c. belonging to it, and proceed regularly to that in which
it is least. Making the equal temperament of Prop. III., (in
which the Vths, IIIds, and 3ds are flattened, 154, 77 and 77,
respectively.) the standard from which to commence the alterations
in the scale required by the unequal frequency of different
chords, and beginning with D, the theorem gives <i>x</i> = 5.
Hence supposing the rest of the degrees in the scale unaltered,
it will be in the most harmonious state, when D is raised <small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>540</sub></small>
of a comma. For by the last proposition, the temperament of
the six concords affected by changing the place of D is best
distributed, and that of the other concords is not at all affected.
We will now proceed to the second degree in the scale, viz.
A; in which the application of the theorem gives <i>x</i> = 13. In
this application, however, as D was before raised 5, <i>m</i>, the
temperament of the Vth below A, must be taken 154 + 5; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in all the succeeding operations, when the exterior termination
of any concord has been already altered, we must take its
temperament, not what it was at first, but what it has become,
by such previous alteration. In this manner, the scale is
becoming more harmonious at every step, till we have completed
the whole succession of degrees which it contains.</p>

<p>Let us now revert to D, the place where we began. As
each of the outer extremities of the chords which are terminated
by D has been changed, a new application of the theorem
will give a second correction for the place of D; although,
as the numbers <i>a</i>, <i>a'</i>, <i>b</i>, &amp;c. continue the same, it will be less
than before. Continue the process through the whole scale,
and a second approximation to the most harmonious state will
be obtained. In this manner let the theorem be applied, till
the value of <i>x</i> is exhausted, for every degree; and it will then
be in the most harmonious state possible. Three operations
gave the following results:</p>

<p>The sign <em>plus</em> denotes that the degree to which it belongs is
to be raised, and <em>minus</em>, that it is to be depressed. The corrections
in each succeeding operation are to be added to those
in the preceding. The errors, in the 3d approximation, are
so trifling, that a 4th would be wholly useless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The foregoing calculations will be rendered much
more expeditious and sure, by reducing the theorem, in some
sense, to a diagram, as in the first of the following figures;

intervals of the enharmonic scale, as in the second.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition VII.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>To determine the temperaments and beats of all the concords,
together with the values of the diatonic and chromatic
intervals, and the lengths and vibrations per second
of a string producing all the sounds, of the system resulting
from the last proposition.</p></div>

<p>The temperaments of all the concords are easily deduced
from Table V. The Vth CG, for example, has its lower
extremity lowered 12, and its upper extremity 14. Hence
it is flatter by 2 than at first, and consequently its temperament=156.
The temperaments of all the concords, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
calculated, will be found in the 2d, 3d, and 4th columns of
Table VII.</p>

<p>Having ascertained the temperaments, the value of the
diatonic and chromatic intervals may be found. The Vth CG
being flattened 156, and the Vth FC 139, the major tone FG
must be diminished 156 + 139, or be = 4820. By thus fixing
the extent of one interval after another, from the temperaments
of either of the different kinds of concords, as is most
convenient, the intervals in question will be found to have
the values exhibited in Table VI.</p>

<p>Let the numbers in this table be added successively, beginning
at the bottom, to the log. of 240, the number of vibrations
per second of the tenor C, (see Rees's Cyc. Art. Concert
Pitch,) and the numbers corresponding to these logarithms
will be the vibrations in a second, of a string sounding the
several degrees of the scale. They are shown in col. 6,
Table VII.</p>

<p>Since the length of a string cæteris paribus is inversely as
its number of vibrations, the lengths in col. 5 may be deduced
from the vibrations in col. 6; or more expeditiously, by subtracting
the numerical distances from C of the several degrees
in Table VI. from O, and taking the corresponding numbers,
from the table of logarithms. These numbers, when used
as logarithms, must be brought back to the decimal form,
agreeably to Scholium 2. Prop. I.</p>

<p>To find the number of beats made in a second by any concord,
it is only necessary to take from col. 5 the numbers
belonging to the degrees which terminate that concord, and to
multiply them crosswise into the terms of its perfect ratio.
The difference of the products will be the number of beats
made in a second. The 3 last columns contain the beats made
by each of the concords, in 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Were we to adhere to Dr. Smith's measure of equal harmony,
the rows of products belonging to the Vths, IIIds, and
3ds, must be divided, respectively, by ⅓, <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></small>, and <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>13</sub></small> (the
reciprocals of half the products of the terms of their perfect
ratios,) before they could be properly added to express the
whole amount of dissonance heard in all the concords; but,
according to Prop. I. the simple products ought to be added,
and the sums at the bottom of the table will express the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
ratio of the aggregate dissonance of the systems under which
they stand. The last has decidedly the advantage over the
first, both in regard to the aggregate dissonance, and the
equality of its distribution among the different classes of concords.
It has nearly an equal advantage over the second in
regard to the first of these considerations; although in regard
to the equality of distribution, the latter has slightly the advantage.
It has, in a small degree, the advantage over the third,
in regard to the aggregate dissonance; while, as it respects the
equality of its distribution, it has the decided preference. It is
true that the temperaments of the concords of the same name,
in the new scale, are not as in the others, absolutely equal;
but no one of them is so large as to give any offence to the
nicest ear. The largest in the whole scale exceeds the uniform
temperament of Dr. Smith's Vths by only <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>18</sub></small> of a comma.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium</em> 1.</h3>

<p>The above system may be put in practice on the organ, by
making the successive Vths CG, GD, DE, &amp;c. beat flat at the
rate contained in Table VII., descending an octave, where
necessary, and doubling the number of beats belonging to any
degree in the table, when the Vth to be tuned has its base in
the octave above the treble C. The tenor C must first be
made to vibrate 240 in a second, the methods of doing which
are detailed at length in various authors. Whenever a IIId
results from the Vths tuned, its beats ought to be compared
with those required in the table, and the correctness of the
Vths thus proved. This system is as easy, in practice, as any
other; for no one can be tuned correctly except by counting
the beats, and rendering them conformable to what that system
requires. The intervals of the first octave tuned ought
to be adjusted with the utmost accuracy, by a table of beats.
When this is done, the labour of making perfect the other
octaves of the same stop, and the unisons, octaves, Vths, &amp;c.
of the other stops, is the same in every system. This last,
indeed, is so much the most laborious part of the tuning of
the organ, that if even much more labour were required than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
actually is, in adjusting the intervals of the octave first tuned
it would occasion little difference in the whole.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium</em> 2.</h3>

<p>The harmony of the IIIds and 3ds in any of the foregoing
systems for the changeable scale is so much finer than it can
possibly be in the common Douzeave, that it seems highly
desirable that this scale should be introduced into general use.
But the increased bulk and expense attendant on the introduction
of so many new pipes or strings, together with the
trouble occasioned to the performer, in rectifying the scale
for music in the different keys, have hitherto prevented its
becoming generally adopted. To multiply the number of
finger keys would render execution on the instrument extremely
difficult; and the apparatus necessary for transferring
the action of the same key from one string or set of pipes to
another, besides being complicated and expensive, requires
such exactness that it must be continually liable to get out of
order. This latter expedient, however, has been deemed
the only practicable one, and has been carried into effect,
under different forms, by Dr. Smith, Mr. Hawkes, M. Loeschman,
and others. But Dr. Smith's plan (which is confined to
stringed instruments) requires only one of the unisons to be
used at once; while those of the two latter nearly double the
whole number of strings or pipes. It deserves an experiment,
among the makers of imperfect instruments, whether a
changeable scale cannot be rendered practicable, at least on
the piano forte,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> without increasing the number of strings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and at the same time allowing both the unisons to be used
together&mdash;either by an apparatus for slightly increasing the
tension of the strings, or by one which shall intercept the
vibrations of such a part of the string, at its extremity, as shall
elevate its tone, by the diesis of the system of temperament
adopted. Were only 4 degrees to the octave, furnishing the
instrument with 5 sharps and 4 flats, thus rendered changeable,
there is little music which could not be correctly executed
upon it.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium</em> 3.</h3>

<p>In the same general manner, may be found the best system
of intervals, for a scale confined to a less number of degrees
than that of the complete Enharmonic scale. In such an
investigation, the numbers in Table IV. expressing the frequency
of all such adjacent degrees as have but one sound in
the given scale, must be united; and the temperaments <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>,
&amp;c. of the theorem, when belonging to concords whose terminating
degrees are united to those adjacent, must be taken,
not what they were in the complete scale, but what they
become, considering them as terminated by the substituted
adjacent degree.</p>

<p>If, for example, the best temperaments were required for a
scale of 15 degrees to the octave, such as is that of some
European organs, or in other words, having no Enharmonic
intervals except D<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> E<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />, and G<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> A<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />,&mdash;the numbers in Table
IV. belonging to C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> and D<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />, E<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> and F, F<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> and G<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />, &amp;c. must
be united, and their sums substituted when they occur, for
<i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>, <i>b</i>, &amp;c. in the theorem; while the temperament, for
example, of the IIId on C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> must not be reckoned 77 as in the
complete scale, but 1261 &ndash; 77 sharp, since its upper termination
has become F, instead of E<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />. With these variations let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the same theorem be applied as before, till no value of <i>x</i> can
be obtained, and the temperaments for that scale will be the
best adjusted possible.</p>

<p>But as the scale which contains but 13 degrees, or 12 intervals,
to the octave, is in much more general use than every
other, we shall content ourselves with stating <em>how</em> the problem
may be solved for scales containing any intermediate number
of degrees, and proceed directly to the consideration of that
which is so much the most practically important.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemma.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>No arrangement of the intervals in the common scale of 12
degrees, which renders none of the Vths or 3ds sharp, and
none of the IIIds flat, can make any change in the aggregate
temperaments of all the concords of the same name.</p></div>

<p>We will conceive the 12 Vths of the Douzeave scale to be
arranged in succession, as CG, GD, DA, &amp;c. embracing 7
octaves. Let them at first be all equal: they will each be
flattened 49. I say that no change in these Vths which preserves
the two extreme octaves perfect, and renders none of
them sharp, can alter the sum of their temperaments. Let
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c. be any quantities, positive or negative, by which
the points C, G, D, &amp;c. may be conceived to be raised above
the corresponding points, belonging to the scheme of equal
Vths. Then as the mean temperament Vth = V &ndash; 49, the first
Vth in the supposed arrangement will be <span class="nowrap">V &ndash; 49 + <i>a</i>.</span> The distance
from C to D will be, in like manner, <span class="nowrap">2 · (V &ndash; 49) + <i>b</i>;</span> and
consequently the Vth GD will be <span class="nowrap">V &ndash; 49 + <i>b</i> &ndash; <i>a</i>.</span> In the
same manner the third Vth DE will be <span class="nowrap">V &ndash; 49 + <i>c</i> &ndash; <i>b</i>,</span> &amp;c.
Hence the temperament of CG = <span class="nowrap">-49 + <i>a</i>,</span> of GD = <span class="nowrap">-49 + <i>b</i>
&ndash; <i>a</i>,</span> of DA = <span class="nowrap">-49 + <i>c</i> &ndash; <i>b</i>,</span> &amp;c. Adding the 12 temperaments
together, we find their sum = <span class="nowrap">-12 × 49 + <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + &amp;c. &ndash; <i>a</i> &ndash; <i>b</i> &ndash;
&amp;c.</span> in which all the terms except the first destroy each
other, and leave their sum = &ndash;12 × 49 which is the aggregate
temperament of the twelve equal Vths in the scheme of equal
semitones.</p>

<p>The same reasoning holds good if we bring these Vths
within the compass of an octave; since, if the octave be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
perfect, all the Vths on the same letter, in whatever octave
they are situated, must have the same temperament.</p>

<p>The reasoning is precisely the same for the IIIds and 3ds,
considering the former as forming 4 distinct series of an octave
each, beginning with C, C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, D and E<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />; and the latter
as forming 3 distinct series of an octave each, beginning with
C, C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" /> and D. If the former be made all equal, each will be
sharpened 343; if the latter be made equal, each will be
flattened 392. In every system which renders none of the
former flat, and none of the latter sharp, the sum of their
temperaments will be 12 × 343, and 12 × 392, respectively.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> The demonstration holds equally true, whatever be
the magnitude of <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c.: only if they be such that the
difference &ndash;<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>, &ndash;<i>b</i> + <i>c</i>, &amp;c. of any two successive ones be
greater than the temperament of the corresponding concord in
the system of equal semitones, the temperament of that chord
must be reckoned negative, and the <em>sum</em>, in the enunciation
of the proposition, must be considered as the excess of those
temperaments which have the same sign with those of the same
concords in the system of equal semitones, above those which
have the contrary sign. Hence it is universally true that the
excess of the flat above the sharp temperaments of the Vths
is equal to 12 × 49; that the excess of the sharp above the flat
temperaments of the IIIds is equal to 12 × 343; and that the
excess of the flat above the sharp temperaments of the 3ds is
12 × 392. Hence likewise we have a very easy method of
<em>proving</em> whether the temperaments of any given system have
been correctly calculated. It is only to add those which have
the same sign; and if the differences of the sums be equal to
the products just stated, the work is right.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition IX.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>If all the concords of the same name, in a scale of twelve
intervals to the octave, were of equally frequent occurrence,
the best system of temperament would be that of
equal semitones.</p></div>

<p>It is evidently best, so far as the concords of the same name
are concerned, that if of equal frequency, they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
equally tempered, unless by rendering them unequal, their
medium temperament could be diminished; but this appears,
from the Lemma, to be impossible. By tempering them unequally,
the aggregate dissonance heard in a given time, by
supposition of their equal frequency, would not be diminished,
whilst the disadvantage of a transition from a better to a worse
harmony would be incurred. Some advocates of irregular
systems of temperament have, indeed, maintained this irregularity
to be a positive advantage, as giving variety of character
to the different keys. But this variety of character is obviously
neither more nor less than that of greater and less degrees
of dissonance. Now, what performer on a perfect
instrument ever struck his intervals false, for the sake of
variety? Who was ever gratified by the variety produced in
vocal music by a voice slightly out of tune? If this be absurd,
when applied to instruments capable of perfect harmony, it is
scarcely less so to urge variety of character as being of itself
a sufficient ground for introducing large temperaments into the
scale. For these large temperaments will have nearly the
same effect, compared with the smaller ones, that small temperaments
would have, when compared with the perfect harmony
of voices and perfect instruments. Possibly a discordant
interval, or a concord largely tempered, might, in a few
instances, add to the resources of the composer. But when
an instrument is once tuned, the situation of these intervals is
fixed beyond his control, and by occurring in a passage where
his design required the most perfect harmony, it might as often
thwart as favour the intended effect.</p>

<p>Since, then, the proposition is true in reference to the Vths,
IIIds, and 3ds, when separately considered, it will be equally
true when they are considered jointly, that is, as formed into
harmonic triads, unless, by rendering the concords of the same
name unequal in their temperament, the mean temperament of
the Vths could be increased, and that of the IIIds and 3ds proportionally
diminished. Could this be done, it might be a
question whether the more equal distribution of the temperament
among the concords of different names, might not justify
the introduction of some inequality among those of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
name. But it is demonstrated in the Lemma, that the sum
of the temperaments of each parcel of concords, in the system
of equal semitones, is the least possible. Hence no changes
in the Vths can diminish the average temperaments of the
IIIds and 3ds.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Hence we derive an important practical conclusion:
that whatever irregularities are introduced into the scale, must
be such as are demanded by the different frequency of occurrence
of the several concords. If we make any alterations in
the scale of equal semitones, this must be our sole criterion.
A given system of temperament is eligible, in proportion to the
accuracy with which it is deduced from the different frequency
of the different concords. And those who maintain that the
frequency of different intervals does not sensibly vary, or that
it is of such a nature as not to be susceptible of calculation,
must, to be consistent, adhere to the scale of equal semitones.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition X.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>To determine the best distribution of the temperaments of
the concords in the Douzeave Scale.</p></div>

<p>As the scale of equal semitones has been demonstrated to be
the best, on supposition that all the concords of the same name
occurred equally often, it ought to be made the standard from
which all the variations, required by their unequal frequency,
are to be reckoned. To find a set of numbers expressing the
relative frequency of the several concords in the common
scale, we have only to unite the numbers in Table IV. standing
against those adjacent degrees which have but one sound in
this scale. They will then stand as in the following table:</p>

<p>The general theorem of Prop. V. is equally applicable to
the determination of the approximate place for any degree in
this scale, considering the numbers in the above table as those
to be substituted for <i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>, <i>b</i>, &amp;c.; and <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and <i>p</i>, in the first
instance, as 49, &ndash;343 and 392, the uniform temperaments of
the Vths, IIIds, and 3ds, in the scale of equal semitones.
Since, however, the temperaments of the IIIds in this scale
are sharp, which would require the signs of the 3d and 4th
terms in the numerator of the general formula to be continually
changed, it will be rendered more convenient for
practice, if they are changed at first, so that it will stand thus:<br />

<i>x</i> =

<span class="blkxxx">

<p>Three successive applications of this theorem to each degree
in the scale, in the manner described Prop. VI., will bring
them very near to the required position, as appears by the

<p class="p1" />
<p>Nothing in the above tables will need explanation, except
the anomalous sharp beats of the 3ds, in the last column.
These are derived from the perfect ratio 6 : 7, because these
3ds are, in reality, much nearer to the ratio of 6 : 7 than to
that of 5 : 6; and hence could their beats be counted, they
would be those of the table, and not those which would be
derived from considering these 3ds as having flat temperaments
of the ratio 5 : 6. But although the beats are slower,
the nearer they approach the ratio 6 : 7, this ought not to be
regarded as any sufficient reason for admitting so large temperaments
into the scale, were it not absolutely necessary, in
order to accommodate those 3ds which are of far more fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>quent
occurrence. Although the beats of these 3ds grow
slower as their temperaments are increased, yet they are losing
their character in melody; and become, in this respect, more
and more offensive, the more they are tempered. Hence the
harmony and melody of the several intervals, jointly considered,
are to be judged of rather from their temperaments, in
the three first columns, than from their beats, in the three last.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium</em> 1.</h3>

<p>It will be perceived, from a comparison of the temperaments
in Table XII. with the corresponding numbers in Table
IX., that the harshness of the several concords, especially of
the IIIds and 3ds, is, in general, nearly in the inverse ratio of
their frequency. The contending claims of the different concords
render it impossible that this ratio should hold exactly.
Including the Vths, the harmony of the concords is much more
nearly <em>equal</em>, than the principle of rendering the temperament
of each inversely as its frequency, could it be carried into
complete effect, would require.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium</em> 2.</h3>

<p>The foregoing system may be put in practice, on the organ,
by making the Vths beat flat, with the exception of those on
C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, E<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />, and G<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, which must beat sharp, at the rate required in
the table; proving the correctness of the temperaments of the
Vths, by comparing the beats of the IIIds, as they rise, with
those required by column two. Should less accuracy be required,
the IIIds on C, D, and A, might be made perfect, without
producing any essential change in the system. This would
reduce the labour of counting the beats to eight degrees only.</p>


<h3><em>Scholium</em> 3.</h3>

<p>To show that the computations of the different frequency of
occurrence of the different concords, on which this system of
temperament is founded, may be relied on as practically cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>rect,
for music in general, it may be proper to state, that a
similar series of calculations had been before made, from an
enumeration of the concords in fifty scores of music entirely
different from that made use of in Prop. IV. They were not,
indeed, made with the same accuracy, for the music of which
the chords were counted, was too generally of the simpler kind,
and the numbers corresponding to those in the two columns
under each concord in Table II., and those belonging to the
major and to the minor signatures, corresponding to the numbers
in Table III., were added, before the products were
taken, instead of keeping the modes distinct, which is necessary
to perfect accuracy. Yet the resulting scheme of temperament
was essentially the same throughout, with the one
which has been just described. It had the same anomalous
temperaments, viz. the Vths on C<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, E<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />, and G<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />; and the
IIId on A; and these anomalies were similar in degree. The
greatest difference between any two corresponding temperaments,
was between those of the 3d on E<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />; the first computation
making it only 702, while the last has it 818.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proposition XI.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>The aggregate of dissonance, heard in a given time, in the system
of temperament unfolded in the last Proposition, will
be less than in either of the systems generally practised.</p></div>

<p>In order to compare the foregoing system with those which
have been most generally approved, the temperaments of all
the concords have been calculated, in the system of equal semitones;
in that of Earl Stanhope, which has had considerable
celebrity; in that of Dr. T. Young; in that of Mr. Hawkes;
in that of Kirnberger, which has been extensively adopted in
Germany; and in that which is described by Rousseau and
D'Alembert as generally practised in France. If these temperaments
be multiplied into the corresponding numbers of
Table IX., agreeably to what was shown under Prop. VIII.,
and those products which belong to the several concords of
the same name be added, the sums, after the three right-hand
figures are cut off, will be as follows:</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>From an inspection of the sums at the foot of the table, it
will be seen that the amount of dissonance heard in a given
time is decidedly less in the new scale than in either of the
others; and that it is scarcely more than half as great as in the
scale of equal semitones. On the other hand, the temperament
is very unequally distributed, which must be admitted,
cæteris paribus, to be a disadvantage. It is even somewhat
greater than in the scheme of Mr. Hawkes, although by no
means in the same ratio, as the aggregate dissonance is less.
It contains one Vth, which will be somewhat harsh, and four
IIIds and three 3ds, which will be quite harsh. But these, as
will appear from an inspection of Table IX., are, of all others,
of by far the most unfrequent occurrence; so that the unpleasant
effect of a transition from a better to a much worse harmony
will be very seldom felt. In the six simplest keys of
the major, and in the three of most frequent occurrence in
the minor mode, they are <em>never</em> heard, except in occasional
modulations; and even then, generally no one, and rarely
more than one is heard. Now these nine keys, as will appear
from Table III., comprise more than five times as much of the
music examined as all the rest. The same remarks might be
extended to three other minor keys, were it not that the sharp
seventh is so generally used, that it deserves to be considered
as an essential note of the key.</p>

<p>But there are two important considerations, more than
counterbalancing the objection to this system, derived from the
greater inequality in the distribution of its temperaments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
which have not been hitherto noticed, as not being susceptible
of mathematical computation.</p>

<p>1st. We have gone on the supposition that tunes on the
more difficult keys are as often performed, according to their
number, as those on the simpler keys; and have taken for the
measure of dissonance, in different systems, what would be
actually heard, if the 1600 scores, whose signatures were examined,
were all played in succession, and on the keys to
which they are set. But the fact is, that those pieces which
are set to the simpler keys are oftener played, and with fuller
harmony, on account of the greater ease of execution, than
those in which many of the short finger keys must be used.</p>

<p>2d. Pieces on the more difficult keys are often played on the
adjacent easier keys, but the contrary is seldom or never done.</p>

<p>Giving to these two considerations no more than a reasonable
weight, they will counterbalance the objection, and will
render it evident that the sums under the several systems in
the table may be taken as a true exhibition of their respective
merits, without any injustice to the more equal systems at the
left-hand of the table.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> We may hence draw a comparison between the systems
in common use. Their merits, when every consideration
is taken into view, are nearly in the inverse ratio of the
sums denoting their aggregate dissonance. That of Mr.
Hawkes is the best, and, in many respects, has a remarkable
analogy to the one derived from the preceding investigations.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> 2. As the aggregate dissonance of the changeable scale
is calculated on the same principles, in Prop. VIII., as that of
the Douzeave in this, a comparison of the results in Table VIII.
with those in Table XIII., will furnish us with the relative
dissonance of different systems for these different scales. The
relative dissonance of the two systems which form the object
of this essay, is nearly as 17 : 27. Hence it appears, that by
inserting eight new sounds between those of the common
octave, the harshness of the music executed, at a medium of
all the keys, may be diminished by more than one third of the
whole, while the transition from a better to a worse harmony
will never be perceived.</p>

Declaration of Independence.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XXII.</span> &nbsp; <em>Notice of Colonel Trumbull's Picture of the
Declaration of Independence.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>t is proper that some mention of this great national work
should be made, in publications less transient than newspapers;
and as the fine arts are included within the design of
this Journal, it may with propriety be noticed here. This
is the greatest work which the art of painting has ever produced
in the United States. The picture is magnificent both
in size and in execution. The dimensions of the canvass are
eighteen feet by twelve.</p>

<p>"This picture forms one of a series long since meditated by
Mr. Trumbull, in which it was intended to represent the most
important events, civil and military, of the American revolution,
with portraits of the most distinguished actors in the
various scenes. The materials for this purpose were collected
many years ago, and two plates have been engraved
from paintings of the deaths of Gen. Warren and Gen. Montgomery;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
but the work was suspended, in consequence of the
political convulsions, which, during twenty-five years, were
so fatal to the arts of peace.</p>

<p>"The government of the United States have ordered four
of the subjects originally proposed by Mr. Trumbull, to be
painted by him, and to be deposited in the capitol.</p>

<p>"No event in human history ever shed a more salutary influence
over the destinies of so great a mass of mankind: the
wisdom of no political act was ever so soon and so powerfully
demonstrated, by such magnificent consequences. And justly
may the nation be proud of the act itself; and of those eminent
men, its authors, whose patriotism (rising above enthusiasm,
and the passions which have so often bewildered mankind) was
calm, dignified, persevering, and always under the guidance of
reason and virtue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p>"The painting represents the congress at the moment when
the committee advance to the table of the president to make
their report.</p>

<p>"It contains faithful portraits of all those members who were
living when the picture was begun, and of all others of whom
any authentic representation could be obtained. Of a small
number, no trace could be discovered; and nothing was admitted
which was not authentic."</p>

<p>This picture is now, by permission of government, exhibited
in the Academy of Arts in New-York, and will probably be
shown in some of our other principal cities, before it receives
its final location at Washington.</p>

<p>It exhibits the interior of the then Congress Hall at Philadelphia.
Most of the members are represented as sitting in
their respective chairs, or, in various instances, as standing in
different parts of the room. Almost all the portraits were
taken by Colonel Trumbull <em>from the living men</em>, and their accuracy
may therefore be relied on.</p>

<p>The president, John Hancock, sitting at a table, and elevated
somewhat by a low platform, is receiving the report of
the committee declaring the independence of the colonies; that
committee, individually illustrious, and in this august transaction
collectively memorable, was composed of Franklin, Adams,
Sherman, Jefferson, and Livingston. Mr. Jefferson, in the
prime of life, is in the act of laying upon the table the great
charter of a nation's liberties; while his companions support
him by their silent but dignified presence, and the venerable
Franklin, in particular, imposes new obligations on his country's
gratitude.</p>

<p>The figures are as large as the life; and it may safely be
said, that the world never beheld, on a similar occasion, a
more noble assemblage. It was the native and unchartered
nobility of great talent, cultivated intelligence, superior manners,
high moral aim, and devoted patriotism. The crisis demanded
the utmost firmness of which the human mind is capable&mdash;a
firmness not produced, for the moment, by passion and
enthusiasm, but resting on the most able comprehension of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
both duties and dangers, and on a <em>principled</em> determination to
combat the one and to fulfil the other.</p>

<p>This moral effect has been produced in the fullest and finest
manner by this great painter; and no true American can contemplate
this picture without gratitude to the men who, under
God, asserted his liberties, and to the artist who has commemorated
the event, and transmitted the very features and persons
of the actors to posterity. Such efforts of the pencil tend
powerfully also to invigorate patriotism, and to prompt the
rising generation to emulate such glorious examples.</p>

<p>The composition and execution in this picture are in a masterly
style. The grouping of so many full length portraits, in
a scene in which there could scarcely be any action, and in
such a manner as to dispose of them without monotony, was an
attainment of no small difficulty. The painter could not even
avail himself of the adventitious relief of splendid costume and
furniture, and of magnificence or rich decorations in architecture;
for on this occasion both were characterized by an elegant
simplicity only, such however as became the actors and
the crisis.</p>

<p>The composition has all the variety of which it is susceptible;
and there is also enough of it in the style of dress and of
features to relieve the eye from any danger of satiety.</p>

<p>It is believed, that in this picture, the United States possess
a treasure to which there is no parallel in the world. In no
instance, within our knowledge, is there an exhibition to an
equal extent, of the actual portraits of an illustrious assembly,
concerned in so momentous a transaction.</p>

<p>It was a great thing to assert, <em>in principle</em>, the liberties of
this country; but it was also a great thing to vindicate them
by arms; and we rejoice that Colonel Trumbull is still to proceed,
under the sanction of government, to delineate other
scenes, in which Washington and his illustrious American
coadjutors, and the flower of French chivalry, were the actors.
In the maturity of his experience, skill, and fame&mdash;possessed,
as he is, of the portraits of most of the great men of that
period, taken principally from the life, and having been him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>self
largely and personally conversant with them in their great
deeds, we trust that the government will promptly second
what we doubt not the united voice of the nation will demand&mdash;that
the illustrious artist should dedicate the evening
of his life to his country's honour and glory.</p>

Country.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XXIII.</span> &nbsp; <em>An Address to the People of the Western
Country.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">A</span> number of the citizens of Cincinnati have recently instituted
a society for the collection, preservation, exhibition,
and illustration of natural and artificial curiosities, particularly
those of the <em>western country</em>. The first efforts of the managers
will be directed to the establishment of a permanent museum,
on a scale so comprehensive as to receive specimens of every
thing curious which they may be able to procure. In attempting
to form this repository, they must of course solicit the aid
of their fellow-citizens in all quarters of the extensive region,
whose ancient works and natural history they propose to illustrate.
The following are the classes of objects that will especially
attract their attention, and to which they are desirous, at
an early period, of directing the views of the community:</p>

<p>1. Our metals and minerals generally, including petrifactions.</p>

<p>2. Our indigenous animals, embracing the remains of those
which are now extinct.</p>

<p>3. The relics of the unknown people who constructed the
ancient works of the western country.</p>

<p>4. The various articles manufactured, for ornament or use,
by the present savage tribes.</p>

<p>The subjects of the first class are considered by the Society
as extremely interesting. Every citizen of the western coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>try
must <em>feel</em> the necessity of a speedy developement of its
mineral resources. To find beneath our own soil an adequate
supply of the various minerals which are now imported at an
enormous expense, must be regarded by all as a matter of the
first and greatest importance. The managers are anxious to
be instrumental in the advancement of this useful work, and
earnestly solicit the co-operation of the public. They will be
thankful for specimens of all the rare or curious minerals that
may be discovered in this country. To every specimen that
may be transmitted, a label should be attached, stating either
the kind of rock or stratum to which it belonged, or its precise
locality. Whenever it is required, the managers will have a
part of any specimen which is sent to them, analyzed, and a
correct report made of its nature, thus affording to the discoverer
a full opportunity of availing himself of all the pecuniary
advantages that may attend the discovery.</p>

<p>As objects of scientific interest, the managers intend, as
early as possible, to commence the formation of a cabinet of
petrifactions. The rocks of few other countries contain a
greater number and variety of these animal remains of the
ancient ocean, than the limestone districts of the Ohio and
Mississippi. They both astonish and confound most of the
travellers through this region; and although objects of familiar
examination to ourselves, they have not been collected or described
by our citizens. An extensive and well arranged cabinet
of these extraneous fossils would afford, both to the zoologist
and geologist, an exquisite feast. It is hoped that every
specimen sent to the Society will be accompanied by a label,
stating the place where it was found.</p>

<p>It is the wish of the Society to obtain and preserve specimens
of all the native animals of this country. Most of the
larger quadrupeds having receded before the unceasing extension
of our settlements, are now so rare as to be unknown
to all but our oldest emigrants. Measures will be taken by
the managers to procure from the general retreat in the northwest,
and exhibit to the people in the Ohio countries, a specimen
of every quadruped which lately inhabited them; and
while engaged in this enterprise, they hope to import from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the same distant wilderness, a variety of the animals which are
peculiar to it.</p>

<p>Our native birds have not retreated, like our quadrupeds,
and are, therefore, within our reach. The managers hope to
see the Society, in due time, in possession of a large collection
of these beautiful animals. In the accomplishment of this
undertaking, it is easy to perceive that the Society may be
powerfully aided by the community: and a sanguine hope is
entertained, that no backwardness or indifference will be
manifested by those who may fortunately have it in their power
to forward specimens.</p>

<p>In collecting the fishes and reptiles of the Ohio, the Mississippi,
and the Lakes, the managers will likewise need all the
aid which their fellow-citizens may feel disposed to give them.
Although not a very interesting department of zoology, no
object of the Society offers so great a prospect of novelty as
that which embraces these animals. The managers, therefore,
flatter themselves that they will not be suffered to proceed
unaided in this portion of their labours.</p>

<p>The obscure and neglected race of insects will not be overlooked,
and any specimens sufficiently perfect to be introduced
into a cabinet of entomology, will be thankfully received.</p>

<p>The western country, from having afforded some of the
most gigantic and curious remains of land animals which have
yet been discovered, seems entitled to a museum of such relics.
A collection of this kind will be one of the earliest objects
of the Society. Its funds will be liberally expended for
the purpose; and if aided by those who may be so fortunate
as to discover any of the great bones which lie buried in our
alluvial or bottom lands, the managers hope, at no distant
period, to repair, in some degree, the losses which have been
repeatedly sustained by exportation of these interesting fossils.</p>

<p>The third class comprises objects of very little utility, but
of extraordinary interest. Nothing, indeed, presented by the
western country seems to excite in a higher degree the curiosity
of strangers, than the relics and vestiges of the extinct
and comparatively civilized population with which it abounds.</p>

<p>The managers will make every possible effort to form an
extensive collection of these remains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>It is extremely unfortunate for those engaged in researches
concerning the objects of this class, that so many of them have
been disseminated abroad. To study them successfully, it is
necessary that they should be compared, and for this purpose
they must be brought together. The managers hope, therefore,
that such persons as now hold, or may hereafter possess
any of these antiquities, will dispose of them to the Society,
instead of sending them out of the country. In this way, and
in this only, can a valuable collection of these unique curiosities
be formed.</p>

<p>The remaining class comprehends the weapons, utensils,
trinkets, and other manufactures of our neighbouring Indians,
of which the managers hope, in a short time, to be able to
exhibit a great variety.</p>

<p>The curiosities of this country are the primary, but not the
exclusive objects of the Society. It proposes in due time to
open a gallery of paintings, and thus offer to the lovers and
cultivators of the fine arts, a few of those models which are
absolutely necessary to the gratification and improvement of
their taste.</p>

<p>The managers will be happy, moreover, to receive from
such of their eastern brethren as are desirous of contributing
to the amelioration and advancement of a new and remote
community, any of the productions of foreign countries that
may be calculated to promote this object; and will, in return,
cheerfully exchange any specimens of the curiosities of this
country which they can spare without injury to their collection.</p>

<p>They will, if required, pay a reasonable price for every
article which may be deemed worthy of introduction into the
museum. They intend to publish, annually, a catalogue of
all the more valuable donations which may be made to the
museum, with the names of the donors.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XXV.</span> &nbsp; <em>A New Lamp, without Flame.</em></p>

<p class="pfs80">From the Annals of Philosophy for March, 1818. Communicated by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Thomas Gill</span>.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>his lamp is one of the results of the new discoveries in
chemistry. It has been found, by Sir H. Davy, that a fine
platina wire, heated red hot, and held in the vapour of ether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
would continue ignited for some time; but, I believe, no practical
use has been made of this fact.</p>

<p>If a cylindrical coil of thin platina wire be placed, part of it
round the cotton wick of a spirit lamp, and part of it above the
wick, and the lamp be lighted, so as to heat the wire to redness;
on the flame being blown out, the vapour of the alcohol
will keep the upper part of the wire <em>red hot</em>, for any length of
time, according to the supply of alcohol, and with little expenditure
thereof; so as to be in constant readiness to kindle
German fungus, or paper prepared with nitre, and, by this
means, to light a sulphur match at pleasure. This lamp affords
sufficient light to show the hour of the night by a watch,
and to perform many other useful services; but does not hinder
the repose of persons unaccustomed to keep a light burning
in their bed-room, nor does it require to be snuffed.</p>

<p>The proper size of the platina wire is the <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub></small>th part of an
inch: a larger one will only yield a dull, red light, and a smaller
one is difficult to use. About 12 turns of the wire will be sufficient,
coiled around any cylindrical body suited to the size of
the wick of the lamp; and four or five coils should be placed
on the wick, and the remainder of the wire above it; and
which will be the part ignited. A wick, composed of twelve
threads of the ordinary sized lamp cotton yarn, with the platina
wire coiled around it, will require about half an ounce of
alcohol to keep it alight for eight hours.</p>

<p>An agreeable and slightly acid smell arises from this lamp
during its ignition. It is perfectly safe, as nothing can fall from
it; and its novel appearance, in a wick's keeping red hot for
such a length of time, is very surprising to persons unacquainted
with its nature.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;When the wire has become oxided, it will be necessary
to uncoil it, and rub it bright again with fine glass-paper;
which will cause it to act again with increased effect.</p>


<p class="p2 pfs70">REMARK.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>Such wire as is here described may, probably, be obtained
in Philadelphia.</p>

organ, which had occurred to the writer, but which was not inserted above on
account of the supposed difficulty of making the change sufficient in degree, he
has since found to have been executed by the Rev. H. Liston, who has succeeded,
by means of shaders capable of being brought before the mouths of his pipes by
the action of pedals, in giving them three distinct sounds each, varying by two
commas. (See the description of his Enharmonic organ, in Rees' Cyc. or Tilloch's
Phil. Mag.) His scale embraces 59 intervals to the octave, and is intended
to produce perfect harmony in all the keys. But as it will require the use of pedals
perpetually, even on the same key, and a ready and perfect knowledge of small
musical intervals, which practical musicians can seldom possess, there is no probability
that it will ever be extensively adopted. Perhaps, however, four or five
sounds, such as D<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, E<img class="glyph" src="images/sharp.jpg" alt="" />, A<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />, D<img class="glyph" src="images/flat.jpg" alt="" />, might be added to the common scale of 12
intervals by means of his mechanism, with advantage. An instrument thus furnished

<em>Esq. dated Paris, 22d August, 1818</em>.</p></div>


<p class="p2 pfs70">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">S</span>ome years since, during Mr. Maclure's geological survey
of the United States, the editor had the pleasure of passing a
few days, in company with that gentleman, in exploring the
geology of the vicinity of New-Haven. Near that town, junctions,
on an extensive scale, between widely different formations,
are to be observed. A radius of ten miles, with New-Haven
for a centre, will describe a circle within which the
geological student may find (with the exception of formations,
unquestionably volcanic) most of the important rocks of the
globe, and a radius of even six or seven miles will include the
greater number of these. At, and near the terminations of the
primitive ranges, there are rocks which appear to have, in a
high degree, the characters of the transition class. Among
them is the beautiful green marble of the Milford Hills, seven
miles from New-Haven. Mr. Maclure visited that district,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and even suggested the first hint which afterward led to the
discovery of the marble. Doubts being entertained concerning
some of the geological relations of those rocks, a letter
was addressed to Mr. Maclure (then in Philadelphia) on the
subject. His answer is subjoined.</p>

<p>In giving it to the public, the editor takes a liberty which
he hopes the respectable author will pardon, because his production,
although evidently never intended for the public eye,
contains statements and opinions of no small importance to the
young geologist, especially of this country.</p>

<p>Geology, at the present day, means not a merely theoretical
and usually a visionary and baseless speculation, concerning
the origin of the globe; but, on the contrary, the <em>result of
actual examination into the nature, structure, and arrangement
of the materials of which it is composed</em>. It is therefore obvious,
that the opinions of those men, who, with competent talent
and science, have, with a direct reference to this subject, explored
many countries, and visited different continents, are
entitled to pre-eminent respect. <span class="smcap">Saussure</span>, by his scientific
journeys among the Alps, (although a limited district) has
given deserved celebrity to his own name, and, if it were possible,
has thrown an additional charm of attraction over those
romantic and sublime regions. Dolomieu has made us familiar
with the productions and phenomena of volcanoes, those
awful and mysterious laboratories of subterranean fire. Humboldt
has surveyed the sublimest peaks of both continents, and
examined the structure of the globe amidst the valleys of
Mexico and the snows of Chimborazo and Pinchinca; and
Werner, with opportunities much more limited, (confined indeed
to his native country, Saxony) but with astonishing sagacity
and perseverance, deduced from what he saw, a classification
of the rocks of our globe, which, although not perfect,
has done immense service to the science of Geology. In this
distinguished group (to which other important names might be
added) Mr. Maclure has unquestionably a right to be placed.
Few men have seen so much of the structure of our globe, and
few have done so much with such small pretensions. His
work on American Geology is noticed with becoming respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
even in Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> that focus of geological science. His
opinions on some of the more obscure and doubtful parts
of the Wernerian geology are worthy of peculiar consideration;
for they are founded on a course of observations vastly
more extensive than Werner ever had it in his power to
make. The name of Werner will always be venerated as
long as geological science shall be cultivated, for geology
owes more to him than to any other man; but his pupils
should not now demand that implicit and unqualified adoption
of <span class="smcap">ALL</span> his opinions, which will allow no other question to be
raised, than what Werner taught or believed.</p>

<p>With these explanatory remarks, the following extract of
Mr. Maclure's letter is now subjoined:</p>


<p class="p2 fs70">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Your letter of the 26th June came just as I was embarking
for Europe. The information it requires concerning the
primitive trap and flint slate, the transition and secondary
rocks, &amp;c. &amp;c. is difficult to give without the aid of specimens,
and frequently requires the examination of the relative position
of the strata before any correct idea can be formed. I
will, however, endeavour to give you the little my experience
has brought me acquainted with.</p>

<p>Following the nomenclature of Werner, I have given a list
of his rocks; but in describing them there are many of his
names which I do not use; because I never met with them.
Primitive trap is one instance&mdash;I do not use trap as a substantive,
except in describing that kind of trap which Werner calls
the newest flætz trap, the nearest to which is your trap,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
which covers the oldest red sandstone.</p>

<p>The primitive flint slate is in the same predicament. I
have always found it on the borders of the transition, between
it and the secondary.</p>

<p>Primitive gypsum I have not found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>What Werner calls primitive trap may perhaps be compact
hornblende, or perhaps the newest flætz trap, when it happens
to cover the primitive; for, this species of trap, like the
currents of lava, covers indiscriminately all classes of rocks,
and is one reason why I consider it as the remains of ancient
lava.</p>

<p>Transition trap is a rock that I have not met with, and may
perhaps be a part of the flætz trap that happened to cover the
transition, without any immediate connexion, but like a current
of lava, overlying all the classes of rocks it meets with.
This misapplication of names naturally arises from the system
of neptunian origin, on which the nomenclature of Werner
is founded.</p>

<p>Greywake and greywake slate are aggregates of rounded
particles of rocks, evidently the detritus of more ancient
formations, and differ from the aggregates of pudding and sandstone
of the secondary class, in the following properties, viz.</p>

<p>The aggregates of transition are harder and much more compact,
than the secondary; they are also cemented by argil,
taking a slaty form.</p>

<p>This cement is in much greater quantity, in proportion to
the particles cemented, and has the appearance as if the
cement at the time of formation, had a consistence sufficient to
prevent the particles from touching each other.</p>

<p>They have, in common with all the transition rocks, a regular
and uniform dip from the horizon, from 10 to 40 degrees;
and sometimes more. This is perhaps the strongest mark of
distinction which separates them from the secondary, which
are horizontal, or follow the inequalities of the surface on
which they were deposited.</p>

<p>The transition are distinguished from the primitive in being
aggregates of rounded particles, having little or no crystallization,
and containing, or alternating with strata, which contain
organic matter.</p>

<p>The oldest red sandstone, with all its accompanying strata,
I should incline to put into the transition, as having many of
the properties of that class, and occupying the same relative
situation in the stratification of the globe. It is at a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
dip (although small) from the horizon; the cement is in
greater quantities in proportion to the particles cemented than
in any of the secondary aggregates, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The character of the secondary is a horizontal position, that
perhaps does not admit of the same facility of examining the
relative situation of its stratification. The compact limestone
is, probably, with reason, considered as the lowest of the secondary
formation, and always under the coal formation, but
it appears to me that the secondary is deposited in basins
alongside of one another, and that each basin has a different
order of superposition, according to the nature of the agents
employed in the deposition; that it is a partial, and by no
means a general deposition. The secondary aggregates of
sandstone and puddings have been evidently beds of sand or
gravel, and of course, in that state would be called alluvial,
but when cemented together by the infiltration of water, carrying
along with it lime, iron, or any other body capable of
agglutinating the particles together, become rocks, and may
alternate in all proportions.</p>

<p>I am therefore inclined to think, that in geology the best
mode for the greatest part of the secondary would be to give
the relative position of the strata of each valley or basin;
and I am rather of opinion that they would all differ from one
another.</p>

<p>The French and English basin having chalk for the lowest
stratum, which has occupied the geologists of both countries
for these 10 or 15 years, is perhaps the best known; yet they
do not know the relative position of the chalk and coals, because
coals have not been found in the same basin with chalk:
coals occupy basins filled with different kinds of rocks, and
have no resemblance to the rocks found covering the chalk.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90"><em>To Benjamin Silliman, Professor, &amp;c.</em></p>


<p><span class="p2 fs70 pad2">SIR,</span><br />

<span class="fs200">H</span>aving recently returned from a tour of considerable extent
in the United States, I avail myself with pleasure of the
first leisure moment, to communicate, agreeably to your request,
some facts, relative to the Mineralogy and Geology of that
part of the country through which I passed.</p>


<p class="p2 pfs70">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</p>
<p class="p1" />

<p>Before doing this, you will permit me to premise, that in
consequence of my limited acquaintance with these branches
of Natural Science, and the still more limited time, which other
and important concerns allowed me to devote to the subject, I
can do little more than give a general description. What my
eye could catch, as I travelled from one country and wilderness
to another, preserving occasionally a few of the most
interesting specimens, was all I could do. The specimens you
have received. The narrative I am about to give, is drawn
principally from the notes which were taken on the journey,
and will be confined to a simple <em>statement of such facts</em> as were
either observed by myself, or derived from good authority.
Their application to preconceived theories, I leave to those
who have more leisure and disposition for speculation than
myself.</p>

<p>A description of a few natural and artificial curiosities which
came under particular notice, will not, I trust, be thought an
improper digression. The whole is committed to your disposal;
and if it shall add but one mite to the treasury of Ameri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>can
Natural History, I shall be gratified, and rejoice to have
made even this small remuneration for your unwearied efforts,
to impart to one, formerly your pupil, a love for Natural Science.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>The Author's Route.</em></p>

<p class="p1">My route was in a line nearly direct from Boston to New-Orleans;
passing through the principal cities to Washington;
thence, diagonally, through Virginia, East Tennessee, and the
northwestern angle of Georgia; in a western course through
the north division of the Territory of Alabama, to the northeastern
boundary of the State of Mississippi; and thence in a
line nearly southwest to Natchez. From this last place I
descended the river Mississippi to New-Orleans. On my return
I frequently varied from this course, and had increased
opportunities for surveying the country. In both instances I
passed through the countries belonging to the Cherokee,
Chickesaw, and Choctaw tribes of Indians, and travelled among
them, in all, about one thousand miles.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Geology of Virginia.</em></p>

<p class="p1">As others have described more minutely and accurately than
I can, the country north of Virginia, I shall begin with a few
remarks on the geological character of that State. It is there
that the traveller, in passing from the Atlantic to the interior,
crosses successively the most important formations of the earth,
from the most recent alluvial to the oldest primitive. For a
considerable distance from the coast, the country is alluvial. It
then assumes an older secondary formation<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>&mdash;and sandstone
and puddingstone are frequent. This is the character of the
District of Columbia, and indeed of a great part of the valley
of the Potomac.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Sandstone of the Capitol, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p class="p1">In this valley, and adjacent to the river, is found the <em>sandstone</em>
of which the President's house, and the Capitol are constructed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
It is composed of fine silicious grains, is easily
wrought, and from its colour, has the appearance at a small
distance of white marble.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Beautiful Breccia.</em></p>

<p class="p1">It is also in the valley of this river, and not far from its famous
passage through the Blue Ridge, that immense quarries
of beautiful Breccia have been opened. This rock was first
brought into use by Mr. Latrobe, for some years employed by
the government as principal architect. It is composed of pebbles,
and fragments of silicious and calcareous stones of almost
every size, from a grain, to several inches in diameter, strongly
and perfectly cemented. Some are angular, others rounded.
Their colours are very various, and often bright. Red, white,
brown, gray, and green, are alternately conspicuous, with
every intermediate shade. Owing to the silicious stones which
are frequently imbedded through the mass, it is wrought with
much difficulty; but when finished, shows a fine polish, and is
unquestionably one of the most beautifully variegated marbles,
that ever ornamented any place. It would be difficult to conceive
of any thing more grand than the hall of the Representatives,
in the Capitol, supported as it is by twenty or thirty pillars
formed of the solid rock, and placed in an amphitheatrical
range; each pillar about three feet in diameter, and twenty in
height. Some idea of the labour which is employed in working
the marble may be formed from the fact, that the expense
of each pillar is estimated at five thousand dollars. The specimens
in your possession, are good examples of its general
structure, but convey no adequate idea of its beauty.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Petrifaction of Wood.</em></p>

<p class="p1">It will be proper to notice in this place, a petrifaction of
wood which is found on the road from Washington to Fredericksburgh,
16 miles from the latter, and four miles north of the
court-house in Stafford county. It is remarkable for its size,
rather than for any singularity in the composition. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
found by digging away the earth on the side of the road, and
appears to have been the trunk of a considerable tree. It is
firmly fixed in the ground, and penetrates it obliquely; how
far has not yet been ascertained. At the time I saw it about
two feet had been exposed. The diameter is about eight
inches. Its colour is white, sometimes resembling that of wood.
The fibres are well preserved, and so is the general structure.
It is much to be desired, that some one would clear it from its
bed, and give it entire to one of our mineralogical cabinets.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Geological Features.</em></p>

<p class="p1">Next to the alluvial and secondary formations, as you pass
to the west and northwest, are to be found ranges of granite
and shistose, and other primitive rocks; interspersed with
these may be seen sandstone, clay, slate, quartz, and limestone.
Granite ranges were particularly seen in the neighbourhood
of Fredericksburgh, crossing the Rappahannock; and in
Orange and Albemarle counties, extending nearly to the Blue
Ridge. Great quantities of quartz and quartz rock, sometimes
covering with their fragments the sides of hills, are frequent.
Another, and more interesting rock in the same connexion, is
found in Albemarle county. For some time I doubted to what
class to refer it. But from its resemblance to the rocks of the
east and west mountains near New-Haven, I ventured to call
it trap or whinstone. It becomes more abundant as you approach
the Blue Ridge, and the granite disappears. On the
sides and summit of the mountain, its appearance is more decidedly
that of greenstone. In crossing the southwest mountain,
the range to which Monticello belongs, and distant from
the Blue Ridge about 25 miles, I observed the same rock.
Whether this opinion is just, you will be able to decide from
the specimens which have been forwarded.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Blue Ridge.</em></p>

<p class="p1">I have repeatedly named the Blue Ridge. It is the first of
those long and parallel ranges of mountains, called the Alle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ghany;
and constitutes one of the most prominent features in
the geology of the United States. Its height I cannot determine
with accuracy. Probably it would not average more than
one thousand feet. Its base may extend in diameter from one
to two miles; and yet such is the influence it has on the climate,
that vegetation on the eastern, is usually two weeks earlier
than on the western side. And what is remarkable, this
difference obtains, on the former side at least, until you arrive
within a few hundred yards of the summit. I crossed the
mountain in two places, distant from each other one hundred
miles, but observed nothing essentially different in their mineralogy.
At one of them called the <em>Rockfish-Gap</em>, on the road
from Charlotteville to Staunton, I spent a few hours, and brought
away specimens of all the varieties of minerals which I could
find. These have been submitted to your inspection. Among
them, you will, I think, see greenstone, epidote, and slate more
or less allied to the first. These are the most common rocks,
and excepting the second, are usually stratified. The epidote
is generally associated with quartz, and sometimes is imbedded
in it. In some instances it has a porphyritic appearance, and
is very beautiful. In others, it is coated with small filaments
of a greenish asbestos. Other minerals were found, whose
nature I could not so easily determine. I regret exceedingly,
that I cannot furnish you with a more complete description of
this interesting mountain. That its character is peculiar, or
different from the country on either side of it, must be obvious
to the most superficial observer. Its principal rock does indeed
bear a resemblance to the trap or whinstone of Albemarle
county, and yet I think you will say it is not the same.
One fact of importance cannot be mistaken; this mountain constitutes
the great dividing line between the granite and limestone
countries. For you no sooner reach its western base,
than the greenstone and epidote disappear; and <em>limestone</em> pervades
the country for hundreds of miles in every direction. In
all the distance from this mountain to New-Orleans, I did not
find a single specimen of granite, or greenstone. This may
appear singular, since Mr. Maclure and Professor Cleaveland
have a granite range on their maps, immediately west of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Blue Ridge; and even that mountain is on those maps, in some
parts of it, covered with the granitic tinge. This may be true.
I can answer for only two points of it, and for that part of the
country beyond, lying near the main road to Tennessee. In
this route I descended almost the whole length of the great
valley included between the Blue Ridge on the east, and the
north mountain on the west. But in no instance did I meet
with specimens of granite; nor west of the Blue Ridge with
any prevailing rock but limestone. I know of no reason why
the Blue Ridge should not be regarded as the first great dividing
line between the granite and limestone countries. The
change in the geological formation is so sudden and striking,
that it would be difficult for the most careless traveller with
his eyes open, not to observe it. The face of nature, he cannot
but perceive, wears a different aspect; the air is more
cool and lively; even the water which he drinks possesses
new properties perceptible to his taste. The inhabitants no
longer speak of their "sandstone water;" but every where
he hears of "limestone water." Indeed for 800 miles in the
direction which I travelled, he tastes no other water. Every
spring and every rivulet, is strongly impregnated with carbonate
of lime. The vessels in which it is prepared for culinary
use, soon become lined with a white calcareous crust. Nor is
its taste the only inconvenience experienced by the traveller
unaccustomed to it. It often injures the health of a stranger,
and covers the surface of the body with cutaneous eruptions.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Limestone country in inclined Strata.</em></p>

<p class="p1">The geological observer has now entered upon a very interesting
field. Its great extent, and its wonderful uniformity,
give new facilities to investigation. Two divisions of it seem
to have been made in nature.</p>

<p>The <em>first</em> is that which includes the limestone lying in <span class="fs70">INCLINED
STRATA</span>. This division extends from the Blue Ridge, to
the Cumberland mountain in East Tennessee, a distance in the
direction of my route of 500 miles. Of course it includes all
the ranges, five in number, of the Alleghany mountains. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
strata lie in a course northeast and southwest, the same as
the general course of the mountains. The angle which they
make with the horizon is very variable, from 25° to 45°. The
colour of the rock varies from blue, and pale blue, to gray, or
grayish white, frequently it presents a dull earthy appearance.
The fracture is more or less conchoidal. Sometimes the rock
assumes a different character, and the fracture is <em>uneven</em>, and
the texture firm. This last is distinguished from the former,
not only by the fracture, but by the colour. It is usually spoken
of by the inhabitants as the <em>gray limestone</em>, the colour of
the other being usually of a bluish cast. It differs from that
also by being less brittle, and possessing the quality denominated
by stonecutters, "<em>tough</em>." In consequence of this, and
its enduring heat better, it is more frequently used in building
than the other. This variety of limestone is not uncommon.
Its colour is not always <em>gray</em>, sometimes it is a reddish brown,
and sometimes white. Immense quantities of it, possessing
either a grayish or reddish brown colour, are found in the vicinity
of Knoxville, East Tennessee. One range of it is
crossed by every road, passing to the south and east of Knoxville.
Its appearance is that of some variegated marbles;
white veins penetrate it, and wind through it in every direction.
Whether any part of it has a texture sufficiently fine
and firm to be wrought to advantage, is yet to be determined.
To the eye of a superficial observer, there are many indications
that it has. A specimen of very fine white marble, resembling
the Italian white, was shown me in Augusta county,
Virginia, which was found 15 miles from Staunton, where there
is said to be a considerable quantity of it.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Limestone country in Horizontal Strata.</em></p>

<p class="p1">The <em>second</em> great division of the limestone country extends,
on the route which I took, two hundred miles from the Cumberland
mountain, and others associated with it southwest, as
far as the Dividing Ridge, which separates the waters flowing
into the Tennessee from those which proceed direct to the
gulf of Mexico. The grand circumstance which distinguishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the limestone of this division from that already described, is
this, <span class="fs70">ITS STRATA ARE HORIZONTAL</span>. Frequently immense piles
may be seen forming bold precipices, but <em>always</em> in horizontal
layers, differing in thickness, from a few inches to many feet.
How far this arrangement extends to the west and north, I
have not yet been able to learn. Travellers always speak of
the limestone rocks in West Tennessee and Kentucky as <em>flat</em>,
from which circumstance I conclude that the Cumberland
mountain forms for a considerable distance at least, the eastern
boundary. I have observed but three other particulars in
which the strata of the <em>horizontal</em> differ from those of the
<em>inclined</em> limestone.</p>

<p>1. Its colour is not so strongly marked with the bluish tinge.</p>

<p>2. It is not so commonly penetrated with white veins of a
semicrystallized carbonate of lime; nor is it so frequently associated
with the <em>uneven</em> fractured species.</p>

<p>3. Petrifactions are oftener found in it.</p>

<p>I will here take the liberty to suggest, whether in our maps
of geology, some notice should not be taken of this very important
division in the limestone country. Such a division exists
<em>in fact</em>; nature has made it; and if geology depends on nature
for its only legitimate inductions, there can be no reason
why a feature so prominent as this, should be overlooked.
I shall not undertake to account for their difference: but would
not every geological theorist consider them as distinct formations?<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Cumberland Mountain.</em></p>

<p class="p1">The Cumberland mountain, which forms a part of this dividing
line, is itself a singular formation. It belongs to the
class called "Table mountains." Its width varies from a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
miles, to more than fifty. Its height is not perceptibly different
from that of the Blue Ridge. It forms a circuit, in a shape
somewhat resembling a half moon. Winding to the southwest,
it keeps a course north of the Tennessee river, in some places
nearly parallel with it; passes a few miles to the southeast
of Huntsville in the Alabama Territory, and not long after terminates.
At one part, over which I crossed, the mountain is
eighteen miles wide. This is about 150 miles southwest of
Knoxville, a little north of the 35th degree of N. Lat. I had
not ascended the mountain more than halfway, before I found
sandstone begin to intermingle with limestone strata. As I
drew near the summit, the limestone disappeared entirely, and
sandstone prevailed in abundance, with no other mineral associated
until I reached the western descent, where I met bold
precipices of horizontal limestone, reaching from the base to
the summit. I examined several sandstone rocks while crossing
the mountain, found them usually imbedded in the earth,
generally with flat surfaces, of a fine grain, and strong texture.
The colour is usually a reddish brown, or grayish red. The
specimen which you have received is a good example. I crossed
this mountain in the vicinity of Huntsville, not less than one
hundred miles southwest of the place above-mentioned, and
found it not wider than mountains commonly are. Its height
had also become less, and horizontal limestone in regular strata
prevailed in every part.</p>

<p>Although this mountain forms a part of the dividing line
which has been mentioned, it does not exclusively so: for the
Rackoon mountain, which crosses the Tennessee river, at the
place so well known by the name of "the Suck," and the
Look-Out mountain, which terminates abruptly about 6 miles
to the left of "the Suck," form an acute angle with the Cumberland,
and are composed of horizontal strata of limestone.
Thus it would appear the line which divides the two kingdoms
of this rock, is nearly north and south, inclining perhaps a few
points to the east and west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Scenery</em>.</p>

<p class="p1">And here I cannot forbear pausing a moment to call your
attention to the grand and picturesque scenery which opens
to the view of the admiring spectator. The country is still
possessed by the aborigines, and the hand of civilization has
done but little to soften the wild aspect of nature. The Tennessee
River, having concentrated into one mass, the numerous
streams it has received in its course of three or four
hundred miles, glides through an extended valley with a rapid
and overwhelming current, half a mile in width. At this place,
a group of mountains stand ready to dispute its progress. First,
the "Look-Out," an independent range, commencing thirty
miles below, presents, opposite the River's course, its bold
and rocky termination of two thousand feet. Around its brow
is a pallisade of naked rocks, from seventy to one hundred feet.
The River flows upon its base, and instantly twines to the
right. Passing on for six miles further it turns again, and is
met by the side of the Rackoon mountain. Collecting its
strength into a channel of seventy yards, it severs the mountain,
and rushes tumultuously through the rocky defile, wafting
the trembling navigator at the rate of a mile in two or three
minutes. This passage is called "The Suck." The summit
of the Look-Out mountain overlooks the whole country. And
to those who can be delighted with the view of an interminable
forest, penetrated by the windings of a bold river, interspersed
with hundreds of verdant prairies, and broken by
many ridges and mountains, furnishes in the month of May, a
landscape, which yields to few others in extent, variety or
beauty. Even the aborigines have not been insensible to its
charms; for in the name which they have given to the Look-Out
mountain we have a laconic, but very striking description
of the scenery. This name in the Cherokee language, without
the aspirated sounds, is "O-tullēē-ton-tannâ-tâ-kunnâ-ēē;"
literally, "mountains looking at each other."</p>

<p>I have already remarked that the limestone of this mountain
lies in horizontal strata: one mile east from its base it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
inclined. Like the Cumberland, it contains immense rocks of
sandstone, but of a coarser grain, verging occasionally into
pudding stone. I was told by a white man, a professed millwright,
that among these sandstone rocks, he knew of many
which were suitable for millstones. At the missionary establishment,
called "Brainerd," eight miles east of the mountain,
I saw one of them which was used for this purpose to
much advantage. It is composed of fine and large grains of
silicious stones, nearly white, and resembling pebbles of white
quartz: the texture is firm.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Silicious Minerals, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p class="p1">I will now notice an important fact, applicable to the whole
extent of limestone country, which has come under my observation.
It is its association with a description of minerals, all
of which appear to be <em>silicious</em>. To describe them minutely,
would require several pages. From the time I entered the
limestone country till I left it this association was observed.
The minerals included in it differ much in their external
character. Their size varies from that of rocks to the smallest
fragments. Usually they lie loose upon the earth, in angular
forms, having the appearance of a stone that has been broken
in pieces by the hammer. Sometimes they cover the sides of
hills and mountains in such abundance as to prevent or impede
vegetation. When the disintegration is minute, they are
serviceable rather than otherwise; and the farmer talks of his
"good black," or "white gravel land." It renders this service,
I presume, not by decomposition, but by preventing the
soil and its manure from being washed away. Indeed the
different varieties of it are generally scattered over the surface,
in pieces so small, that for convenience sake, the whole
may be denominated a <em>silicious gravel</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mineral is imbedded in limestone, in the
form of nodules, thus indicating their original connexion
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The varieties, so far as I have observed, are quartz, hornstone,
flint, jasper, and semi-opal; and several, which to me
are non-descripts. <em>Quartz</em> is the most abundant. It is found
of different colours; compact, and porous or cellular; of every
size; simple and associated with other silicious stones; massive
and crystallized. In Augusta and Rockbridge counties in
Virginia, beautiful crystals of quartz, of a singular form, are
found. They are six-sided prisms, with double acuminations,
that is, with six-sided pyramids, mounted on the opposite ends
of the prism. A specimen of two such crystals united, you
have received. It was found near Lexington. A curious variety
of the quartz gravel-stone occurs on both sides of Elk
River, a few miles above its junction with the Tennessee, in
the Alabama territory. As you travel to the west from Huntsville,
it appears first in the neighbourhood of Fort Hampton,
two miles east of Elk River, and may be seen for ten miles
west of that river. The mineral is remarkable for containing
a curious petrifaction. Its first appearance is that of a solid
screw. On examination, however, you find it is not spiral;
but consists of parallel concentric layers. Their diameter
varies in different specimens, from that of a pin to half an inch.
They stand in the centre of a hollow cylinder, extending its
whole length, and occupying about one-third of its dimensions.
The stone is sometimes perfectly filled with these forms. The
petrifaction I could not have named, had you not pronounced
it the "Entrochite."</p>

<p><em>Hornstone</em>, next to quartz, is the most abundant of the silicious
minerals associated with limestone. It is very often
seen imbedded in rounded masses, both in the inclined and
horizontal strata.</p>

<p><em>Flint</em> is more rare. Several fine specimens were observed
on the western declivity of the Look-Out Mountain, but in no
instances in large masses or quantities.</p>

<p><em>Semi-Opal</em> was found in one instance on the dividing ridge,
which constitutes the southwestern boundary of the limestone
strata.</p>

<p>Of the non-descripts you have several specimens. One
variety strikes fire with steel, is a milk-white colour, adheres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
slightly to the tongue, and has no degree of translucency on
its edges. As Mr. Kain has furnished you with an interesting
detail of particular minerals found in East Tennessee and
Western Virginia, I need not recapitulate what he has so well
said.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">B</span>elmont county is bounded on the north by Jefferson
and Harrison, on the west by Guernsey, and south by
Monroe county, and on the east by the Ohio river. It is
27 miles in length, and 21 in breadth, containing 535 square
miles. Its name, <em>Belmont</em>, or beautiful mountain, indicates its
situation, for it contains within its boundaries a fine body of
land, rising gradually as you are travelling from the Ohio to
the west, until you arrive at about the middle of it, where,
from the elevation on which you stand, the eye in an eastern
direction, beholds one of the most charming prospects in the
state. Looking towards the east, in a pleasant morning, you
behold a beautiful country of hill and dale spread out before
you, divided into convenient and well-cultivated farms, intersected
by glittering streams, meandering through them towards
the Ohio. You hear the lowing of numerous herds
around you, the shrill matin of the songsters of the forest, and
the busy hum of the industrious husbandman; you see here
and there a clump of trees interspersed among the cultivated
parts of the country; you see the comfortable dwelling-house,
the substantial barn, and hear the rumbling noise of the
mill; and when you reflect that those who dwell here are industrious
and enterprising, virtuous, free, and happy, you
behold with pleasure, and listen with delight, while reflecting
on the objects around you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Geology and Mineralogy.</em></p>

<p class="p1">On the surface is seen a rich vegetable mould, made by the
decay and putrefaction of vegetable substances. Along the
Ohio, a wide intervale of the richest alluvion is found, which
produces as luxuriant a growth of vegetation as any in the
world. On the banks of the creeks which pass through this
country the alluvial soil is not so wide as that on the river,
but equally rich and productive. On the hills (and there are
many of them) there are two kinds of soil, the silicious and
the argillaceous, the first is formed from the decomposition of
the rocks which once covered the surface, the latter from the
slate which lay under them. Where these rocks are decomposed,
and the country is hilly, it will readily be believed
that the two kinds of soil are frequently blended together. In
some places we see the best of clay for bricks; whilst in other
places, and those in the vicinity of the former, we find the
best of sand to mould them in when manufactured. Hard
limestone of the very best quality is found in detached fragments
in the sides of hills, and in strata, in abundance, along
the beds of streams.</p>

<p>The ruins of the sandstone formation are here seen scattered
about in fragments, or decomposed and intimately
blended with those of other formations.</p>

<p>Fossil coal is every where found under the hills, of the very
best quality, and in sufficient quantity not only for the fuel of
the present, but many future generations, and is so easily obtained
that the expense of fuel is a mere trifle. The oxide of
iron, or iron ore variously combined, is recognized in many
places, and water combined with muriate of soda, or common
salt, is as common. Salines or licks are found in many places,
where animals also, both wild and domesticated, resort in great
numbers to drink the waters. These are frequently near some
little water-course. Several sulphur and chalybeate springs
are known to exist in this county, and some which throw out
considerable quantities of petroleum.</p>

<p>In a country where iron and fossil coal exist, it is no wonder
that copperas should be found. There are places where copperas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
exudes in a state sufficiently pure in quality, and in
quantities sufficient for several families, who collect and use it
in dying. The same may be said of alum, which is collected
in the same way for similar purposes.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Botany.</em></p>

<p class="p1">Though this county is very rich in the mineral, yet it is not
less so in the vegetable kingdom, as may be seen by a reference
to the subjoined catalogue, although numbers of trees,
shrubs, and plants, are purposely omitted, which are known
to exist here.</p>

<p class="noindent">The red bud; the pawpaw; grape-vines of several species, and
growing to a great size; sassafras; the black willow, confined
to the streams; the box elder, the common elder, of two
species; the sumach, of two species; several species of gooseberries;
and a great many others too numerous to be mentioned
here. Among the herbaceous plants we must not omit
the ginseng, the Virginia snakeroot, the columbo, and the
puccoon, two or three thousand pounds of the roots of which
are annually carried by the inhabitants to our Atlantic cities.
Among the trees, those belonging to the oak family are the
most numerous, if not the most valuable. Split into rails, the
farmer builds fences with them, and sawed into plank, boards,
and scantling, they furnish materials for houses and barns. The
sugar maple is sufficiently abundant, so that brown sugar
enough is manufactured for domestic purposes. The sycamore
is the largest tree along the river, and the poplar is the
largest on the hills. The latter grows by the side of the maple
and the beach, and is a most valuable wood for the house-builder
and the cabinetmaker. This tree is frequently four
and five feet in diameter, and continues of nearly the same
size as it ascends, 40, 50, and sometimes even 60 feet.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Streams.</em></p>

<p class="p1">The Ohio is the eastern boundary of this county, forming
wide intervales along its banks. Indian Wheeling is a fine
mill stream rising in Harrison county, and after crossing this,
empties into the Ohio, opposite the town of Wheeling, which
stands on the Virginia side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Captina is another excellent mill stream, which after running
about 17 or 18 miles in this county, puts into the Ohio 23
miles by water below Wheeling. These streams visit and
fertilize a considerable part of Belmont.</p>

<p>From the view we have taken of this county, its geology,
mineralogy, and botany, the reader will probably be prepared
with us to conclude, that no part of the union, of equal extent,
contains within it greater natural resources, or can support a
more dense population.</p>

<p>The seat of justice is St. Clairsville, situated ten miles from
the Ohio river, at Wheeling. It contains three houses for
public worship, 15 stores, a printing-office, a bank, and 700
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants of this county are Quakers or
Friends, who are charitable, humane, frugal, enterprising, industrious,
and strongly opposed to slavery. From such a population,
possessing such advantages, what may we not hope
and expect from their exertions? Their fertile valleys will
be turned into meadows, and their hills into pastures; the ox
will fatten in the former, whilst the flocks of Andalusia will
whiten the latter.</p>

near Edinburgh, Scotland; and on the Aqueous origin of
Wacke; by</em> <span class="smcap">J. W. Webster, M.D.</span> of Boston.</p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he country around Edinburgh is extremely interesting to
the geologist, and presents numerous instances of the junction
of rocks to which the advocates of the Neptunian system have
referred in support of their opinion as to the aqueous origin
of greenstone, basalt, and wacke; while the same examples
have been cited by the Volcanists, and by those who hold an
intermediate opinion. The structure of a portion of Calton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
hill, where the most distinct alternations of substances (whose
aqueous origin none can dispute,) with pure and well characterized
wacke are displayed, has not, as yet, I believe been
particularly described.</p>

<p>Edinburgh is situated nearly in the centre of an extensive
coal formation, where the usual sandstones and other coal
measures are connected with the newer rocks of transition.
From the coal field rise in many places beds of greenstone, in
general forming small conical and round-backed hills. Other
eminences are composed of amygdaloid, claystone, and other
porphyries; and basalt and trap tuff occur in an overlying position.
Of these, it is not my intention to speak otherwise
than as conveying a general idea of the geological relation of
the wacke above referred to.</p>

<p>The structure of Calton hill has been exposed by the recent
improvements, and in particular by a section made in the construction
of the new road to London. The rock occurring in
greatest abundance, and which is probably the fundamental
bed, is a porphyry, the basis of which in general is claystone,
which in many places passes into felspar, in others becomes a
distinct greenstone. Numerous veins of calcareous spar traverse
it in different directions, and I am lately informed, that
very beautiful examples of veins of greenstone of contemporaneous
formation with the rock itself, have been discovered
<em>in</em> the greenstone. Upon the porphyry rests a bed of trap
tuff, upon this other beds of the two rocks repose, that at the
summit being porphyry. The back of the hill (as we pass
from the city) is a spot of peculiar interest, consisting of alternate
thin beds of bituminous shale, sandstone, wacke, and
clay ironstone, disposed in a manner which will be best understood
by a rough outline taken on the spot.</p>

<p>The wacke has a greenish gray colour, which is pretty uniform.
The fracture is nearly even and earthy, it is soft, yielding
readily to the nail, and has a feebly shining streak. A
slight stroke with the hammer causes the mass to separate in
fragments of various size, the surfaces of which are often
smooth and shining, each bed being composed of large distinct
concretions, having a tendency to the prismatic form. This
wacke fuses with difficulty before Brooke's blow-pipe. Specific
gravity not determined, as it falls to pieces on being moistened.</p>

<p>The sandstone is for the most part gray, in some parts spotted
red and brown, forming, as the section represents, the last
stratum seen; the beds of sandstone are but a few inches in
thickness, and the last (17) becomes less than an inch; it is
probable, however, from the relative situation, from the dip
and direction, that these strata are a continuation of others
seen on the other side of the hill, where they are of sufficient
thickness to have been quarried for the purposes of architecture.
The <em>beds</em> of all rocks we know vary greatly in different
parts, and it is not unusual for them to be some feet at one
extremity, gradually decreasing till less than an inch in thickness
at the other, or they may even be lost entirely, and gradually
regain their former size; and it is not improbable that
these beds of sandstone will be found to continue on towards
the adjoining hills of Salisbury Craig and Arthur's Seat, passing
under the greenstone and trap tuff.</p>

<p>The bituminous shale presents the usual characters; intermixed
with it are numerous nodules of the common clay ironstone,
the colour of which is a yellowish brown, these also
frequently present characters common to the three substances,
and throughout the beds, the passage from the one to the
other is distinct. Whatever may be the opinions in regard to
the origin of bituminous shale, there can be but one in regard
to that of sandstone; and this has lately received no feeble
support from the account given us by Dr. Paris, of a formation
of this rock on the coast of Cornwall, where, says he, "we
actually detect nature at work, and she does not refuse admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>tance
into her manufactory, nor conceal, with her accustomed
reserve, the details of the operations in which she is engaged."</p>

<p>From the appearances which have been thus briefly noticed,
no impartial geologist, we should imagine, would infer the
<em>volcanic</em> origin of any portion of this formation; and if the
aqueous origin of sandstone can be established, that of the
wacke must be the same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From its intimate connexion with the preceding subject,
Dr. Webster subjoins the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Extract from a Paper on a recent formation of Sandstone,
occurring in various parts of the Northern coast of Cornwall</em>;
by <span class="smcap">John Ayston Paris</span>, M.D. F.L.S., &amp;c. &amp;c. Published
in the Transactions of the Geological Society of Cornwall,
1818.</p></div>

<p>"A very considerable portion of the northern coast of
Cornwall, is covered with a calcareous sand, consisting of minute
particles of comminuted shells. That part which lies between
St. Ives and Padstow is more immediately the subject of the
present inquiry; a tract which, with a few exceptions, is entirely
covered with this species of sand; and which in some
places, has accumulated in quantities so great as to have formed
hills of from forty to sixty feet in elevation. A considerable
area, for instance, in the parishes of Gwythian and Phillack
has been thus desolated, and several churches have been inundated.
In digging into these sand hills, or upon the occasional
removal of some part of them by the winds, the remains of
houses may be seen; and in some places, where the churchyards
have been overwhelmed, a great number of human bones
may be found. The sand is supposed to have been originally
brought from the sea by hurricanes, probably at a remote period."&mdash;&mdash;"The
sand first appears in a slight but increasing state
of aggregation on several parts of the shore in the bay of St.
Ives; but on approaching the Gwythian river, it becomes more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
extensive and indurated. On the shore opposite to Godrevy
Island, an immense mass of it occurs, of more than a hundred
feet in length, and from twelve to twenty feet in depth, containing
entire shells and fragments of clay slate; it is singular
that the whole mass assumes a striking appearance of stratification.
In some places it appears that attempts have been made
to separate it, probably for the purpose of building; for several
old houses in Gwythian are built of it."&mdash;&mdash;"It is around the
promontory of New Kaye that the most extensive formation
of sandstone takes place. Here it may be seen in different
stages of induration; from a state in which it is too friable to
be detached from the rock upon which it reposes, to a hardness
so considerable, that it requires a very violent blow from
a sledge to break it."&mdash;&mdash;"But it is on the western side of the
promontory of New Kaye, in Fistril Bay, that the geologist will
be most struck with the formation; for here no other rock is
in sight. The cliffs, which are high, and extend for several
miles, are entirely composed of it."&mdash;&mdash;"The beach is covered
with disjointed fragments, which have been detached from the
cliff above, many of which weigh two or three tons."</p>

<p>There are three modes by which Dr. Paris conceives the
lapidification of calcareous sand may be effected. 1st. "By
the percolation of water through a hill of calcareous sand, by
which it becomes impregnated with carbonate of lime." 2d.
"The percolation of water through strata containing pyritical
substances, by which it becomes impregnated with sulphuric
salts." 3d. "The percolation of water through decomposing
slate, or any ferruginous strata, by which it becomes impregnated
with iron alumina, and other mineral matter."</p>

<p>The following notices were prepared before the receipt of
the above letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Molybdena</em> is found in Shutesbury, Massachusetts, near
Northampton, east of Connecticut River, on the land of
William Eaton. It is the common sulphuret, but remarkably
beautiful and well characterized. Its colour is nearly that of
bright lead, very brilliant, smooth, and almost unctuous; soft,
flexible, distinctly foliated, and the folia are very thin, and
easily separable, almost like mica. It gives the usual greenish
trace on white pottery, while a line drawn parallel on the same
basis, by a piece of plumbago or black-lead, is black; this
being (as pointed out by Brongniart) the easiest criterion, by
which to distinguish between molybdena and plumbago, or
black-lead. We have many times applied it with entire success.</p>

<p>This molybdena, from Shutesbury, is chiefly crystallized,
and the crystals are, in some instances, very distinct; their
form is that of a flat six-sided prism, or what is commonly called
a table. The rock, from which they were obtained, is a
granitic aggregate, (judging from the specimen sent, it may be a
true granite) and the forms of the crystals are very distinctly
impressed in the stone, so that when removed they leave an
exact copy or crystal mould. In a letter from the proprietor
of the land, it is said that the molybdena is found in a ledge of
rocks, six or seven feet above the surface of the earth, and
about ten or twelve feet above the level of the water; the
direction of the rocks is from S. to N. E. by N.; the metal is
in a vein, running E., and was discovered in small pieces in the
top of the ledge. After putting in two blasts, some large pieces
were obtained.</p>

<p>From this account, and from the specimens, (some of the
crystals being an inch or more in length) this must be one of
the most interesting localities of molybdena hitherto observed
in this country; and it is hoped Mr. Eaton will take some pains
to procure and furnish specimens.</p>

<p><em>Rose Quartz.</em>&mdash;From Southbury, Connecticut, not far from
Woodbury, and from the Housatonick River, two young men,
of the name of Stiles, have brought us specimens of <em>rose
quartz</em>, of delicate and beautiful colour. It is said to be abundant
in a ledge of the same substance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Plumbago.</em>&mdash;In Cornwall, Litchfield county, Connecticut,
plumbago is found, of a good quality, and in considerable
masses, in a vein contained in a rock of gneiss, or mica-slate.
It has been known a good while, and is said to have been exported
anterior to the American revolutionary war.</p>

<p><em>Coal, &amp;c.</em> in Zanesville, Ohio. Through the kindness of
the Rev. Dr. Bronson, Principal of the Cheshire Academy,
we have received the following information.&mdash;In cutting a
canal in the above town, in the spring of 1817, through freestone,
trees, and fish, and other substances, both animal and
vegetable, were taken out, alike petrified to a freestone, excepting
the bark of a beach tree, which was very perfect and
beautiful coal&mdash;(as we have had an opportunity of ascertaining,
from an examination of the specimens.)</p>

<p><em>Coal</em>, in the county of Muskingum, Ohio. Common stone-coal,
highly bituminous, (the slaty or black coal of Werner,)
is found abundantly.</p>

<p><em>South of Lake Erie</em>, about 25 miles, in the bed of Rocky
River, are found shells, and other animal remains, imbedded
in argillaceous iron; the specimens were collected in 1817,
by the Rev. R. Searle.</p>

<p><em>Mammoth's Tooth</em>, from the River St. Francis, west of
Mississippi. Return J. Meigs, Esq. has transmitted, through
the Rev. E. Cornelius, a mammoth's tooth, apparently not
mineralized. It appears to have belonged to a very old animal,
as the processes, (which, it is well known, are commonly
very prominent) are worn down smooth, and some of them
almost obliterated.</p>

<p><em>Blue Ridge, Tennessee, and Mississippi Territory.</em>&mdash;Through
the kindness of the Rev. E. Cornelius, and of Mr. John H.
Kain, we have received a considerable collection of specimens,
illustrative of the mineralogy and geology, and Indian antiquities
of these regions; they may be, on a future occasion, the
subject of more particular remarks.</p>

<p><em>Coal</em>, in Suffield, Connecticut, on the river of the same
name. From Mr. Nathan Stedman, we have received specimens
of coal, found in thin veins, in rocks of slate, and argillaceous
sandstone, on the banks of the river. The veins are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
thin, but considerably numerous; the coal is very glossy and
black; breaks with a smooth and almost conchoidal fracture,
and very much resembles jet. It is very much intersected by
thin veins&mdash;(not thicker than a knife-blade)&mdash;of white crystallized
calcareous spar. This coal is bituminous, and burns
pretty freely. It has not been explored, except superficially.</p>

<p><em>Coal</em>, in Southington, Connecticut. Beds of slate are found
more or less bituminous; and, at the bottom of some of the
wells, the slate begins to exhibit thin veins of coal, distributed
in great numbers through the substance of the slate, which is
the shale of the miners. The coal is from the thickness of a
knife-blade to that of a finger; it is highly bituminous, and
burns with great freedom. Even the entire masses of the
stone burn brilliantly, when ignited on a common fire; and,
after exhaustion of the coally matter, leave the slate of a grayish
colour.</p>

<p>The locality from which the specimens were taken, is on
the land of Roswell Moore, Esq. about midway between Hartford
and New Haven. The spot was lately examined by Col.
Gibbs, Eli Whitney, Esq. Professor Olmstead, and others; and
arrangements are making to bore the strata, to the depth of
several hundred feet, if necessary. These localities are in
what may, with propriety, be called the coal formation of
Connecticut. Coal has been found in several other places in
that state; and the peculiar geological features of the region
in which it is contained, are very interesting, and may hereafter
be described in form.</p>

<p><em>Sulphat of Barytes, with Coal, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Sulphat of barytes exists
abundantly in Southington, on what is called the Clark
Farm. With quartz, carbonate of lime, &amp;c. it forms the gangue
of a metallic vein, containing galena, or sulphuret of lead,
copper pyrites, &amp;c. The sulphat of barytes is more or less
crystallized, and principally in the form that is called the coxcomb
spar. The same vein, although it is in the side of a
mountain, several hundred feet above the flat country adjacent,
and two or three miles from the coal strata above mentioned,
contains numerous spots and patches of coal, very much
resembling that at Suffield. It is of a most brilliant black, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
contrasted with the white, stony matrix, (principally quartz
and sulphat of barytes) in which it is enveloped, it forms elegant
specimens.</p>

<p><em>Scintillating Limestone.</em>&mdash;In Vermont, a singular scintillating
limestone is found, of which an account is given in the following
extract of a letter from Mr. George Chase, dated Randolph,
February 19, 1818.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>"The object of the present letter is to acquaint you with a
circumstance relating to the limestone that abounds in this primitive
country, which to me is inexplicable. This carbonate
of lime is of a pale sky-blue colour; effervesces strongly with
nitric acid; and, by burning, produces lime, so that there is
no question as to the identity of the mineral. But it likewise
gives forth sparks with steel:&mdash;this I concluded, at first, to be
an accidental circumstance; but every specimen that I have
tried, from various quarters of the country, uniformly gives
fire with steel. The limestone is found in layers, in blocks,
and masses, disseminated among the clay-slate that covers the
greatest part of the townships in this vicinity. When first
taken from the earth, and exposed to the air, it is covered with
an incrustation of a dark reddish-brown colour, that crumbles
easily between the fingers, and is generally from one inch to a
foot in thickness. This incrustation, however, hardens on a
long exposure to the air. This led me to think that the incrustation
was owing to the decomposition of the limestone,
which was produced by the sulphuret of iron, intimately disseminated
through the rock, which would also explain the singular
circumstance of its striking fire. But on dissolving a
small quantity of the mineral in nitric acid, and adding a drop
or two of the decoction of gallnut, no discolouring of the
liquor was produced."</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p><em>Limpid Quartz.</em>&mdash;West Canada Creek, a northern branch
of the Mohawk, affords, in its sands, small crystals of quartz,
limpid, and terminated at both ends by pyramids of six sides;
we are indebted for specimens to Professor Fisher.</p>

<p><em>Fetid Primitive Limestone, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;From the vicinity of Williamstown
College, through the kindness of Professor Dewey, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
have received specimens illustrative of the geology of that region.
Among them is limestone from Stockbridge, crystallized
in large plates and rhomboids, almost white, and still fetid on
being rubbed, which is very different from most fetid limestones,
which are dark coloured, and even black, and do not
belong to primitive formation.</p>

<p><em>Molybdena.</em>&mdash;In Pettipaug, Saybrook, Connecticut, molybdena
occurs. It is mentioned in the Review of Cleaveland's
Mineralogy, and is here cited again for the purpose of pointing
out its locality more exactly. It is found about half a mile
to the E. of the Turnpike leading from Saybrook to Middletown,
on the first road on the right hand above the turnpike
gate, near the house of the widow Pratt. It is not far from
Pettipaug meeting-house, in a northern direction.</p>

<p><em>Beryl.</em>&mdash;In Haddam, Connecticut, are found many beryls,
and some of uncommon size; an account of one of the most
remarkable localities is contained in the following memorandum
from the Rev. Mr. Mather, to whom we are indebted for
specimens.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>"The place in which the beryls are found is in the town of
Chatham, about one mile and a half north from Middle-Haddam
landing; about half of a mile S. W. of a large hill, on which
is the cobalt mine. The rock in which the beryls are contained
is granite; the parts of which are very large, especially
the felspar and the mica. Large masses of shorl are
also found in these rocks. Beryls have also been found in
other parts of Middle-Haddam, amongst rocks of the same description.
The <em>greatest</em> diameter of the largest beryl is four
inches; the <em>least</em> three inches. The beryls are numerous,
and of different sizes; though few are less than an inch, or
two inches in diameter. The length of the longest beryl is
five inches."</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p><em>Clay.</em>&mdash;Near Delhi, New-York, a few rods from the Delaware
river, are found beds of clay, of which specimens have
been transmitted by Mr. John P. Foote, of New-York. We
are of opinion that they are not porcelain clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Gypsum.</em>&mdash;Cayuga Lake. We are informed by Dr. L. Foot,
that the workmen who have excavated about 20 feet on the
border of the lake, in gypsum, which is generally of a dark
brown, or black colour, when they come to a transparent crystallized
piece, call it isinglass, and reject it as worthless: the
hint should be remembered by mineralogists, that the specimens
may be saved for their cabinets.</p>

<p class="pfs70">ASBESTOS IN ANTHRACITE.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><em>Extract of a letter from Dr. I. W. Webster.</em></p>

<p class="p1 right">
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, 27th Nov. 1818.</p>

<p class="p1 pad1"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>In examining some masses of the anthracite from
Rhode Island, one piece attracted my attention, from the
waved structure of the lamellæ into which it separated. The
fragments of this were wedge-shaped, and I found the space between
some of the laminæ filled up by a fibrous, silky substance,
which induced me to break up other masses, in one of
which I discovered an abundance of amianthus; the filaments
are of a light-green colour in some parts of the mass&mdash;in
others presenting different shades of brown. With a microscope,
I found the fibres intermixed with the anthracite; or
forming thin layers, and these sometimes parallel to, at others
crossing, in different directions, the course of the laminæ.
How far the presence of this mineral may influence the ignition
or combustion of the coal, is a question, perhaps, worth determining.
Should my engagements permit, I shall make further
examination, and inform you. In the mean time, the notice
of this fact may call the attention of some of your readers
to the subject. At any rate, this substance has, I believe,
never before been noticed in connexion with anthracite, and
is highly interesting in a geological point of view.</p>

<p class="pfs70">REMARKS.</p>

<p>We have been familiar with the Rhode Island anthracite,
and with the formation of rocks in which it is found; and, long
since, observed the fact mentioned by Dr. Webster. The asbestos
often is in the form of the most delicate amianthus,
frequently blended also with the slate rocks, which form the
roof and pavement of this coal. A specimen now lies before
us, in which a complete vein of this amianthus, with fibres
nearly two inches <em>in length, connects and pervades</em> a mass of
slate, supposed to be of the transition class.</p>

<p>Similar facts are mentioned also by Dr. Meade, in his account
of the Rhode Island coal.</p>

<p class="pfs70">RED PYROXENE AUGITE.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Extract of a letter to the Editor, from Dr. H. H. Hayden of
Baltimore.</em></p>

<p>I have very lately discovered a couple of small specimens
of the transparent <em>red</em> pyroxene, resembling fine crystals of
titanium, which I, at first, mistook it for. One of them is contained
in the middle of a large crystal, like the rubellite in the
green tourmalins of Massachusetts, but it is not the same substance.
The pyroxene, which I have reference to, is the
olive-coloured epidote of some, pistazite of others, but resembles,
in this instance, the sahlite; the crystals being divisible
longitudinally. Some of them are five inches long, and half
an inch diameter, hexaedral and double; that is, two joined
together, as described by Brochant in particular.</p>

of Yale College</em>. (<em>With a Plate.</em>)</p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he plant, which is the subject of the following observations,
is found growing abundantly on the sandy plains east of
Cedar Hill, in New-Haven. It is locally associated with the
asclepias viridiflora and verticillata. When this species of
asclepias was first noticed by me, it was supposed to be a
variety of viridiflora of Rafinesque and Pursh; but after examining
a great number of specimens, it was found that the
varieties did not blend themselves. The leaves of the viridiflora
being uniformly oblong and obtuse, the leaves of the
other uniformly lanceolate and acute. To this new species I
purpose to give the name Lanceolata.</p>

<p><em>Specific character of the asclepias lanceolata</em>:&mdash;Stem decumbent,
hirsute; leaves opposite, lanceolate, acute, sub sessile,
hirsuit umbels lateral, solitary, sessile, nodding, subglobose,
dense-flowered; appendage none. See the plate.</p>

<p>The asclepias lanceolata is allied to the asclepias longifolia
and viridiflora by the absence of appendage or horn of the
nectary. It is distinguished from the longifolia, which is
characterized by alternate linear leaves, and umbels erect.</p>

<p>The asclepias lanceolata and asclepias viridiflora belong
to Mr. Elliott's genus acerates. In both, the nectary or
stamineous crown is short concave, and oppressed to the
angles of the filaments.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">D</span>iplocea. <em>Generic definition.</em> Flowers paniculated monoical
or polygamous. Exterior glumes membranaceous bivalve
one to three flowered, valves subequal emarginated
mutic. Anterior glumes bivalve unequal, the largest notched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
notch aristated, the smallest mutic entire bearded. <em>Additional
characters.</em> Flowers when single sepile with a lateral jutting
peduncle, when double, one sepile and one pedunculated,
when three two are pedunculated and alternate. The hermaphrodite
and male flowers are similar: the female are
nearly clandestine, inferior. Stamens 3, styles 2. Seeds
ovate oblong.</p>

<p><em>Observations.</em> This genus is intermediate between <i>amphicarpon</i>,
Raf. (<i>Milium amphicarpon</i>, <i>Pursh</i>) and <i>aira</i>, L. It
differs from this last by its polygamy, variable number of
flowers, notched valves, &amp;c. The generic name means <em>double
notch</em>. Its type is the following species, which had been
ranged with the <i>aira</i>, by Walter, and considered doubtful by
Pursh.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><i>Diplocea Barbata.</i></p>

<p><em>Specific definition.</em> Stems cespitose, articulations bearded;
leaves rough glaucous, neck ciliated; panicles, few flowered,
female axillary; largest valvet rinervate, and ciliated as well
as the awl.</p>

<p><em>Latin definition.</em> Caulibus cespetosis, geniculis barbatis,
collo ciliato, foliis scabris glaucis, paniculis paucifloris, femineis
axillaribus; valva majore trinerva, aristaque ciliata.</p>

<p><em>Description.</em> Roots, annual fibrous: stems many, unequal,
rather procumbent at the base, next assurgent, rising one foot
at utmost; they are geniculated, slender, brittle, weak, and
smooth. The knees or joints are bearded, the sheaths are
split, the neck ciliated, the leaves short, stiff, rough glaucous,
linear acute, obscurely striated. The panicles have few
flowers, particularly the female ones, which are axillary
coarctated almost hidden, while the male are terminal and
divaricate: some hermaphrodite flowers are occasionally, but
seldom found among both panicles; they are all similar, differing
only in the want of stamina or pistils. The valves of the
exterior glumes are nearly equal oblong notched obtuse, mutic
and oneneroed. The valvules or valves of the glumule
(corolla or interior glume) are unequal, the largest is ciliated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
trinerve bifid, with a soft ciliated awl in the notch, as long as
the valve: the small valve is ovate acute concave, very hairy
on the back. The colour of the flower is reddish or pale
red; but variable.</p>

<p><em>Observations.</em> This plant is probably the <i>aira purpurea</i> of
Walter, Pursh, Elliott, &amp;c. but does not belong to that genus.
It was found in Carolina, but I have found it on Long-Island,
near Gravesend, Bath, Oyster-Bay, &amp;c. on the sandy and
gravelly sea-shore: it grows probably in the intermediate
states. It blossoms in August and September, has no particular
beauty, but a very singular appearance. The specific
name of <i>purpurea</i> was improper, since the colour of the
flowers is variable from whitish to red.</p>

<p class="pfs80">(Communicated by the Author.)</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">A</span>lthough I have not devoted a particular study to this
department of the science of nature, yet I have been amused
and instructed by casually observing many of the subjects of
it, when I have been rambling in their native haunts, pursuing
objects more particularly interesting to me.</p>

<p>But when perusing, the other day, the account of the copper-head
of our country, by Mr. Rafinesque, I was impelled
to ask for information on the subject, through your useful
publication, in which that account appeared, and to make, at
the same time, a few miscellaneous remarks or notes. These
are in part included in the present essay, and if they should
have a tendency to incite attention to the reptilia of the
United States, at present in a state of confusion and incertitude,
some portion of benefit will be rendered to the great
cause of science.</p>

<p>I think that a moderate degree of labour and observation
bestowed upon the investigation of the species already described,
would prove the unity in nature of some species
which have been considered as distinct by all the authors,
would detect many errors in observation, expose some deceptions
practised on credulity by the designing, and would enable
us to fix, with some degree of accuracy, our knowledge
of truth and of the species.</p>

<p>A work devoted particularly to this class, by some one
adequate to the task, who could have in his view all the
known species, is indeed a desideratum.</p>

<p><i>Scytale cupreus</i>, Copper-head, &amp;c. of Mr. Rafinesque. I
have always considered the Copper-head to be no other than
the <i>Cenchris mockeson</i> of authors, and <i>Boa contortrix of Linn.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
v. Latr. Lacep. Shaw, Daudin, &amp;c. <i>Agkistrodon mokasen</i> of
Beauvois; which opinion is not a little corroborated by an
actual comparison of one of these animals in Peale's Museum,
with the descriptions of the authors above mentioned. It
may be objected to me, that the <i>mockeson</i> of those naturalists
is a <i>Cenchris</i>, and not a <i>Scytale</i>, therefore generically distinguished
from the Copper-head; but on the other hand, we
know that the genus <i>Cenchris</i> does not exist in nature, that the
individual upon which it was founded, was either a fortuitous
variety, or that the illustrious naturalist was deceived by the
desiccation of his specimen, giving to the basal caudal plates a
bifid aspect. That the former was the case I analogically
infer, from having seen, in the collection of the Academy of
Natural Sciences, a <i>Coluber heterodon</i>, of which the fifth and
sixth pairs of caudal scales were entire, and not as usual bifid.
An additional corroboration of the truth of this inference is
derived from the circumstance of the <i>Scytale</i> of Peale's Museum,
having the ten or eleven apical caudal plates bifid,
precisely as in the genus <i>Acanthophis</i>, to which it seems
closely affianced, and to which it would be referred if this
character was a permanent one. In every other character
this specimen coincides with the <i>S. mockeson</i> of authors, and
in every necessary respect with the <i>S. cupreus</i> of Mr. R. with
the sole exception of the calcarate termination of the tail.
This caudal horn seems to approximate Mr. R's. animal to the
<i>S. piscivorus</i> or true horn-snake, about which the credulous
have so absurdly alarmed themselves, and which was arranged
with the <i>Crotali</i> by Lacepede, in consequence of having a horn
on the tail an inch long. We find sometimes a small indurated
tip to the tail of <i>Coluber melanoleucus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> at least upon some full
grown specimens, formed by the elongation and appression of
the terminal scales; a larger one on that of the European
viper, and of the <i>Acanthophis cerastes</i>, and <i>Brownii</i>. Mr.
Peale's specimen certainly has not the horn, but it has at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
termination of the tail a scale somewhat longer and more indurated
than the others, the individual had not attained his
full growth. If then this species (and some others) is subject
to vary in the form of its caudal plates, from which the generic
characters are in part estimated, may it not also vary in the
armature of the tail, which at most can only be considered as
specific. The Copper-belly is a very distinct species. If the
<i>S. cupreus</i> is, notwithstanding the above observations, considered
a distinct species, it would gratify those who cultivate natural
history, to have some good discriminative characters of it.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written about antidotes to the
venomous bites of snakes, and Mr. Rafinesque enumerates over
again several plants which have been said to be, and which he
appears to believe to be specifics. If the case was my own, I
would be very unwilling to rely upon either of the 20 or 30 medicinal
plants, dubiously mentioned by the late Professor Barton,
as reputed antidotes for this poison. It would be more prudent
to resort unhesitatingly to a more certain remedy, in the ligature,
and immediate excision of the part, where such an operation
was practicable, or to cauterization, if the part could not
be removed by the knife.</p>

<p>In conversation with Professor Cooper upon this subject,
he informed me that in his domestic medical practice he applied
common chalk to the wounds occasioned by the stings
of hymenopterous insects. That in consequence of this mode
of treatment, the pain was immediately allayed, and the consequent
inflammation and intumescence were prevented.
The experiment which led to this result was induced by the
supposition that the venomous liquid might be an acid, which
opinion was, in some degree, justified by the event.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Upon the
same neutralizing principle it must be supposed that any alkali
would be beneficial. The learned Professor supposed, that
the venom of the poisonous reptilia may, in like manner, be
an acid secretion, and recommends this to be ascertained by
experiments upon the liquid itself.</p>

<p>If this inference proves correct, the same alkaline remedy
may be employed to neutralize, or so modified as to stimulate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
in case, as is supposed by some, the poison produces upon the
system a typhoid action.</p>

<p>An instance however is related in the Trans. Royal Soc. of
Lond. of the unsuccessful administration of the vol. alkali in case
of the bite of a Rattle-snake; and an intelligent physician of
Georgia informed me, that he had applied the same stimulant
in vain for the cure of the bites of poisonous snakes, but that
being once stung by a Scorpion, he was instantaneously relieved
by the topical use of this liquid. He further related to me a
cure performed under his observation, by means of the singular
antidote, which has often been resorted to in case of snake
bites, that of the application of a living domestic fowl or other
bird directly to the wound; three fowls were applied in this
instance, of which two died in a few minutes, it was supposed,
by the poison extracted from the wound. This account, from
an observant medical professor, (who may nevertheless have
been deceived) acquires some additional title to consideration
by a similar event which lately occurred at Schooley's Mountain,
New-Jersey. We are informed from a respectable source,
that a boy was there bitten by a Copper-head, (Scytale mockeson.)<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The part was immediately painful, became swollen
and inflamed, and the sufferer had every appearance of having
received a dangerous wound. A portion of the breast of a
fowl was denudated of feathers, and applied to the wound; in a
few minutes the fowl died, without having experienced any
apparent violence or injurious pressure, from the hand of the
applicant, the breast exhibiting a livid appearance. Another
living fowl was then laid open by the knife, and the interior of
the body placed upon the wound. The wound was subsequently
scarified, and variously administered to. The boy however
recovered, and his cure was generally attributed, at least
in part, to the application of the birds. I am as far as any one
from relying implicitly upon this mode of treatment, and would
only resort to it when the part bitten could not be extirpated,
and when a cautery was not at hand. Yet it must be confessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that from the numerous attestations to its efficacy we should
be almost led to suppose a very strong affinity to exist between
the venom and the animal thus applied.</p>

<p>That so numerous a catalogue of plants have gained credit
with the uninformed as specifics, will not be surprising, when
we know that the reservoir of the venom is very readily exhausted
and slowly replenished. When this reservoir is vacated,
the reptile is of course innoxious, and the most inert plant
would then stand a good chance of gaining reputation with the
credulous as a specific.</p>

<p>For a similar reason we have so many cures for the bite of
a rabid animal; and it may be for a similar reason that the
body of an animal has acquired repute as an antidote, against
the venom of a serpent.</p>

<p><i>Coluber trivittata</i> of Mr. R. <a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a>, of this work. Judging
from the descriptive name and the locality, is the <i>C. sirtalis</i> of
authors, or possibly the <i>C. saurita</i> or <i>C. ordinatus</i>. These
serpents have each the three vittæ, though in the two former
this trait is much more striking. I know of no other serpent
in our vicinity to which the name can be characteristically
applied. The <em>ordinatus</em> has been called <em>bipunctatus</em> and <em>ibibe</em>
by the French school. What is the difference between <i>sirtalis</i>
and <i>saurita</i>? they must be very closely allied, if not synonymous.</p>

<p><i>Coluber getulus</i>, Lin. This species attains to a more considerable
magnitude than authors have stated. I saw a specimen
on Cumberland Island, Georgia, at least five feet long.
The ground colour, by the direction of light in which I viewed
him, was deep glaucous or livid, he was much more robust
than <i>C. Constrictor</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He permitted my near approach, without
agitating his tail in the menacing manner of the serpent
just mentioned, and of the crotali, or manifesting any signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
fear. In my anxiety to secure him, he eluded my grasp, and
by a sudden and rapid exertion, disappeared, with all the rapidity
of movement so remarkable in the <i>constrictor</i>. This last,
from his celerity, is known in many districts by the name of
<i>Racer</i>.</p>

<p><i>Coluber heterodon.</i> This viperine species, of which Latreille
has formed a genus under the name of <i>Heterodon</i>, varies considerably
in its markings, and like most of our serpents, is not
constant in the number of its plates and scales, (126, 48-138,
42-141, 42, &amp;c.) perhaps too much reliance has been
placed upon colour, and upon the number of the plates and
scales beneath the body, of the Ophidiæ generally. In the
form of the anterior termination of the head, the <i>heterodon</i> is
remarkable, and a good specific character may be obtained
from the orbital scales, which are eleven or twelve in number;
the parabolic curve which passes through the eyes, and terminates
at the maxillary angles, is also generally present. This
same serpent was figured in Deterville's ed. of Buffon, under
the name of <i>Coleuvre cannelee</i>. The <i>heterodon</i> abounds in
many sandy situations, and near the sea-shore. Several persons
pursuing a pathway, passed within a few inches of one of
them without his betraying any emotion, but the moment he
perceived me advancing with my eye fixed upon him, he with
a sudden exertion assumed a defensive attitude, by elevating
the anterior portion of his body, flattening his head, and 3 or
4 inches length of his neck; these he waved with a steady and
oblique motion from side to side, uttering at the same time an
audible sibilation, he made no attempt to escape, and seemed
absolutely fearless until taken. They have the habit of the
vipera, but not the fangs. It seems to be synonymous with
<i>Coluber simus</i>. This species is often called <i>mockeson</i>. Dr.
Shaw's description of <i>Boa contortrix</i> seems to indicate this
species. Was he deceived by an erroneous reference to
Catesby's figure of this Hog-nose? or by Forster's catalogue?</p>

<p><i>Coluber punctatus.</i> A good diagnostic character of this species,
in addition to the cervical cestus, rests in the triple series of
abdominal dots; but these are often wanting or obsolete in the
young specimen, in which state it is probably the <i>torquatus</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Shaw. Sometimes the dots are wanting on the neck and near
the cloaca; and in one aged individual, the intermediate line
occurred double, and confluent on the throat.</p>

<p><i>Coluber fulvius</i>, this species is said by Daudin to be closely
allied to his <i>C. coccineus</i>, notwithstanding the difference in
plates and scales. But it is certainly very distinct by other
characters, and strikingly so in its perfectly annular black and
red bands; the latter are margined with yellowish and spotted
with black. A specimen has 224 plates and 32 scales, total
length 21 inches, length of the tail 1<small><sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub></small> inch. The <i>coccineus</i>
has the under part of the body whitish, immaculate. The
<i>fulvius</i> seems to belong to the genus <i>vipera</i>; it has the fangs,
but not the orifice behind the nostril, which communicates
with the reservoir of venom, so conspicuous in the <i>crotali</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Ophisaurus ventralis.</i> The tail of this snake not only
breaks in pieces when struck with a weapon, but portions of
it are thrown off at the will of the serpent. This singular
fact I witnessed in Georgia. This is one of the many which
are called horn-snakes. A tip of the tail of one of them was
once brought to me as having been taken from a recently
withered tree, which the bearer assured me was destroyed
by the insertion of this formidable instrument, and it was not
without considerable difficulty he was convinced of the innocence
of the tail, and of having been the dupe of a knave.
There seems to be a peculiar character in the mode of imbrication
of the scales of this species, each one of these at the
lateral edges, passes beneath the lateral scale on one side, and
over the edge of the opposite one. It has been described
under five different generic names, and four different specific
ones.</p>

<p>The <i>Crotali</i> do not gain a single joint only to the rattle annually,
as is generally supposed. They gain more than one
each year, the exact number being probably regulated in a
great measure by the quantity of nourishment the animal has
received. Rattle-snakes in Peale's Museum have been observed
to produce 3 or 4 in a year, and to lose as many from
the extremity during the same time. Hence it is obvious, that
the growth of these curious appendages is irregular, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the age of an individual cannot be determined from their
number. Mr. Rubens Peale informed me, that a female of
<i>Crotalus horridus</i>, Beauv. <i>durissus</i>, Daud. which lived in his
Museum more than fourteen years, had eleven joints to her
rattle when first in his possession; that several joints were
acquired and lost annually, and that at her death, which occurred
last year, she had the same number as when brought
to the Museum; she had, however, during that time received
an accession of four inches to her length. Her death was occasioned
by an abortion.</p>

<p>The <i>C. adamanteus</i>, Beauvois. <i>Rhombifer</i>, Daud. is by
much the largest of our North American serpents, and doubtless
is the species which Catesby saw a specimen of, eight
feet long.</p>

<p><i>Crotalus miliarius</i> varies in some characters from those laid
down by authors. A specimen within my view has five dorsal
series, of alternate, irregularly orbicular black spots, those of
the intermediate series are obsolete, and slightly connected
across the back, those of the vertebral series have not red
centres, and are edged with a white line; the ventral spots
are disposed adventitiously, so as not to be traced into longitudinal
series; they are large, black, irregularly orbicular,
and occupy about one half of the surface, which is white.
Ventral plates 140; subcaudal, 33, of which the six terminal
ones are bifid. Joints of the rattle with but one transverse contraction
on the middle of each, besides the terminal contraction.
Total length 1 foot 4¼ inches, tail two inches. It appears to be
more vindictive than the two species before mentioned. The
individual here noticed we encountered in East Florida; he
struck at Mr. W. Maclure and myself successively as we passed
by him, without any previous intimation of his presence, owing
to the inaudible smallness of his rattle, and its having but three
joints; he was killed by Mr. T. Peale, (whom we preceded)
while preparing for another assault. This incident is noted as
a contrast to the anecdote of the <i>Coluber heterodon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Salamandra alleganiensis</i>, Daud. appears to be synonymous
with <i>S. gigantea</i> of Dr. Barton. It was first described by Mr.
Latreille in Deterv. Ed. of Buffon, tom. 11. The name <i>alleganiensis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
although defective, as it indicates no character, has
however the unalienable right of priority.</p>

<p><i>Salamandra subviolacea</i>, Barton. This name has been rejected
by Mr. Daudin, and substituted by that of <i>venenosa</i>, I do
not know for what reason, as none is assigned.</p>

<p><i>Salamandra punctata</i>, Gmel. This appellation was originally
given and restricted to the <i>stelio</i> of Catesby. tab. 10. (represented
in the bill of Ardea Herodias) and was adopted by
many subsequent authors, but was finally rejected by Daudin,
who considered the species the same as Barton's <i>subviolacea</i>.
He concurred with Mr. Latreille in appropriating the name
thus rejected to <em>var. β</em> of <i>Lacerta</i>, <i>aquatica</i> of Gmel. Notwithstanding
this high authority I cannot but coincide with Professor
Barton in this instance, in believing it altogether distinct.
The single character of the subocellate spots, though not remarked
by this author, is a sufficiently discriminative one;
these ocellæ are always present, and in no one of the varieties
I have seen has the approximation to the <i>subviolacea</i> been so
considerable as to render a specific discrepance equivocal.
Catesby's variety with the ocellæ on the tail seems to be the
least common; in general these spots, or epupillate ocellæ, are
exclusively confined to a line on each side of the back, about
six in each, extending from the base of the head to the origin
of the tail, though there are sometimes scattered smaller ones
on each side of the body, and upon the vertex of the head,
they are of a beautiful reddish colour, enclosed by a definite
black areola; the upper part of the body is brownish, with
numerous, distant black points, and a slight vertebral, obtuse
carina, the inferior surface of the body of a fine yellow or
orange, with distant black points, the tail<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> is compressed, ancipital,
attenuated to an obtuse tip, longer than the body, and
punctured with black in like manner. The younger specimens
vary considerably, in being, on many parts of the body,
destitute of black punctures, and in having the dorsal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ventral colour, of the same pale orange. It is decidedly aquatic.
Several specimens are preserved in the collection of the
Academy of Natural Sciences, and from these it is evident that
the reddish colour of the subocellate spots is destroyed by the
action of the antiseptic liquid; to this circumstance it is probably
owing that these spots have been hitherto described as
white.</p>

<p>After stating these differential traits, it may be proper to
observe, that the <i>S. maculata</i> of Shaw is synonymous with the
above. But I think it most proper to restore Gmelin's name
<i>punctata</i>, which will afford an opportunity to do justice to the
memory of Laurenti, by reviving the original name by which
he distinguished the <em>Var. β. of Lacerta</em>, <i>aquatica</i>, Gmel., that
of <i>parisinus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bufo cornuta.</i> This animal, which has been stigmatized as
the most prodigiously deformed <em>creature</em> known to exist!! is
generally supposed to inhabit North America as well as Surinam.
I do not think it has ever been found in North America.
Shaw, in Nodder's Nat. Misc. says it is principally found in
Virginia, but in his General Zoology, I think he says that Seba
was in error when he represented its native country to be
North America. Two other species of <i>Bufo</i> have been correctly
stated to inhabit this country, viz. <i>B. musicus</i>, and
<i>Crapaud rougeâtre</i>, Daud. (B. rubidus) first noticed as distinct
by Mr. William Bartram. I discovered a third species on the
banks of St. John's river, East Florida, which, as I am not at
present prepared to describe, I shall not surreptitiously name.</p>

<p>It is, I conceive, an incumbent duty on the describer of a
natural object, to deposit his specimen, or a duplicate, when
practicable, in some cabinet or museum, to which he should
refer, in order that subsequent writers may be satisfied with
the accuracy of his observations, by examining for themselves.
By such reference, and by the re-examination of the same
objects by others, the plethoric redundance of synonyma, that
prolific source of accumulating error, will be banished or elucidated,
and naturalists will most readily arrive at the knowledge
of truth, which is, or ought to be, the grand leading object
of their labours.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>By</em> <span class="smcap">Wm. G. Reynolds</span>, M.D. <em>Middletown Point, New-Jersey</em>.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">S</span>hould the progress of science, for a century to come,
keep pace with its rapid advancement for the last fifty years,
many appearances in the physical world, now enveloped in obscurity,
will then admit of as easy solution as the combustion
of inflammable substances, or any familiar process in chemistry
does at this day. Among the many subjects from which
the veil of mystery would thus be raised, we may include
those luminous appearances, in the aerial regions, called meteors,
which I am about to consider in the following essay;
and which seem to constitute a distinct class of bodies of considerable
variety.</p>

<p>Meteors were regarded by the ancients as the sure prognostics
of great and awful events in the moral and physical world;
and were divided by them into several species, receiving
names characteristic of the various forms and appearances
they assumed; but of their opinions, as to the physical cause
of these phenomena, the ancients have left us nothing solid or
instructive. The moderns, more enlightened, have ceased to
regard these bodies with the superstitious awe of former ages;
but in respect to the cause thereof, are perhaps but little in advance
of their predecessors, having, I believe, produced
nothing yet that will bear the test of philosophical investigation.</p>

<p>Doctor Blagden (Philosophical Transactions, 1784,) considers
electricity as the general cause of these phenomena; Doctor
Gregory, and others, think they depend upon collections of
highly inflammable matter, as phosphorus, phosphorated hydrogen,
&amp;c. being volatilized and congregated in the upper re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>gions
of the air. Doctor Halley ascribes them to a fortuitous
concourse of atoms, which the earth meets in her annual track
through the ecliptic; and Sir John Pringle seems to regard
them as bodies of a celestial character, revolving round centres,
and intended by the Creator for wise and beneficent purposes,
perhaps to our atmosphere, to free it of noxious qualities,
or supply such as are salutary. Many other theories, as
ingenious as fanciful, might be enumerated; but without commenting
on their comparative merit, I must acknowledge that
none of them have yet impressed my mind with a conviction of
their truth. A series of observations, however, have enabled
the moderns to ascertain, with apparent accuracy, several particulars
relative to these stupendous bodies, which add much
to our knowledge of their general character:&mdash;their velocity,
equal to 30, and even 40 miles in a second of time; their altitude,
from 20 to 100 miles; and their diameter, in some instances,
more than a mile, are facts we derive from respectable
authority, and may aid us, essentially, in forming just conceptions
of their nature and properties.</p>

<p>I believe meteoric stones to result from all meteoric explosions;
limiting, however, the term meteor to those phenomena,
in the higher regions of the air, denominated fire-balls,
shooting-stars, &amp;c. That these bodies move in a resisting
medium, must be evident to every attentive observer; and
that this medium is our atmosphere, is pretty certain, 1st. Because
we know of no other resisting medium round the earth;
2dly. Because the same kind of resistance is apparent at every
intermediate altitude, from their greatest to their least, which
last we know to be far within our atmospheric bounds; and,
3dly. Calculation has, in no instance, assigned them an elevation
beyond the probable height of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>That meteors proceed from the earth, that they arise from
certain combinations of its elements with heat, and that meteoric
stones are the necessary result of the decompositions of
these combinations, are opinions I will endeavour to support,
by the following considerations.</p>

<p>1st. The properties and habitudes of matter, under certain
conditions and combinations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>2dly. The situation of the earth's surface in respect to the
sun, the influence of his rays thereon, and the nature of the
elements or compounds on which these rays act:</p>

<p>And 3dly. The identity that exists between the component
parts of meteoric stones, and the elements that enter abundantly
into the composition of our globe; and, by several other facts
and arguments.</p>

<p>Under my first general specification, I will select such principles
from the established doctrines of philosophy, as have an
immediate bearing on the subject; without engaging in any of
those subtle speculations in which certain recondite properties
of matter, or the identities of quality and body are affirmed or
denied.</p>

<p>Thus, 1st. Heat is the universal cause of fluidity and volatility
in bodies; hence no solid can assume the state of gas, until
it absorbs, or unites with, a certain portion of caloric; and the
subtilty and volatility of compounds thus formed, will be in a
due ratio to the quantity of caloric they employ.</p>

<p>2dly. The heat employed to maintain a body in the gaseous
state, is said to be latent or fixed, and may be regarded as an
ocean or atmosphere of fire, holding the ultimate particles of
the body in a state of extreme division, and wide separation,
from which they can be driven only by some change in the affinities
or condition of the compound.</p>

<p>3dly. If the latent heat in a gaseous compound be suddenly
abstracted, as in explosion, its escape is attended with the
emission of light and sensible heat, when the volatilized particles
held in solution being no longer able to maintain the state
of gas, suffer approximation in a due proportion to the quantity
of caloric they have lost.</p>

<p>4thly. Caloric, in reducing solids to the state of gas, lessens,
but cannot in any case, as far as we know, totally destroy their
gravitating force; the diminution of this force, however, being
in a direct proportion to the quantity of heat employed.&mdash;Hence
the following inferences may be fairly drawn, as they
seem to be in unison with the relative dependence and harmony
existing between the material elements of this globe, and,
I believe, are contradicted by no direct experiments; viz. that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the expansion of volume, specific levity, and subtilty of artificial
gases, are in a direct proportion to the absolute quantity
of caloric they employ; and the caloric is in the same proportion
to the insolubility of the substance with which it
unites.</p>

<p>5thly. When the specific gravity of bodies on the surface
of the earth, is reduced below that of the superincumbent atmosphere,
they ascend to media of their own density, in obedience
to the laws of Aerostatics; thus we raise balloons by
filling them with light air, and the carbon of pit coal and common
wood exposed to combustion, and water to the sun's rays,
will rise until they reach a medium of like specific gravity with
themselves.</p>

<p>6thly. Mechanical agitation and division assist the solution
of solids, by bringing fresh portions of the menstruum into successive
contact with their fragments, and thus exposing a larger
surface.</p>

<p>Under the second head I proceed to notice the situation of
the earth's surface in respect to the sun, &amp;c. The atmosphere
is a thin, elastic, gravitating fluid, that completely envelopes
the earth, to which it may be considered a kind of
appendage or external covering; its base resting on the earth's
surface, is of an uniform density, growing rare as it recedes
therefrom, in a due ratio to the diminution of its gravitating
force, until it is lost in empty space. The atmosphere is estimated
on certain data to be about 44 or 45 miles high, but
we have good reasons to believe it fills a much wider circle,
though too thin to reflect the rays of light above its reputed
height.</p>

<p>The earth presents one whole hemisphere to the sun in unerring
daily succession; and those parts of it which have the
least protection against his rays, will, cæteris paribus, suffer
the greatest intensity of their action. Within the tropics, the
atmosphere opposes less resistance to the sun's rays than in
the temperate zones; and in both large tracts of cultivated
land, the summits and sides of great ranges of mountains, margin
of oceans, rivers, &amp;c. present an almost naked surface to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
their influence.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The exterior strata of the earth, and especially
the more exposed parts thereof, envelope in their compounds,
elements of an identity of character with those composing
meteoric stones.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is the great recipient of all volatilized bodies;
it possesses but feebly the powers of a solvent, unaided
by heat or moisture, but when these are adjuvants, no body in
nature can totally resist their action for a long time.</p>

<p>Now if the above principles are admitted, we have in their
application a reasonable solution of most meteoric phenomena.
Thus, the rays of the sun darting through the atmosphere
reach the surface of the earth, where, by accumulation, they
produce sensible heat, which though not intense, is steady and
uniform, for many hours every day; minute portions of the
earthy and metallic compounds exposed to the sun's influence,
will be volatilized by the absorption of heat, and thereby assuming
the state of elastic fluids, will ascend until they arrive at
media of their own density. The atmosphere in contact, will
have some of its particles blended in these compounds, will
ascend with them, and to supply the vacuum, new portions of
air will rush in and ascend, and the process will continue until
the sun's rays are withdrawn, or interrupted by some of the
common occurrences of nature.</p>

<p>The utmost height to which these elastic fluids ascend, may
be estimated at something more than one hundred miles; and
they float at every intermediate distance between their greatest
elevation and the clouds, but rarely below the latter, except
their course is directed towards the earth in their explosions.
They probably ascend at first in small daily detached
portions of gaseous clouds, and are diffused over wide regions;
but having no sensible resistance opposed to their mutual attraction,
they will by the laws of their affinities congregate into
immense volumes of highly concentrated elastic fluids, which
on exploding will exhibit all the phenomena of bursting meteors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
in the following manner, viz. the latent heat on escaping
will manifest itself in the form of fire and light, the force with
which it strikes the atmosphere, or the rebound of the latter to
fill the vacuum, or both, will occasion sound more or less detonating
or hissing, as the escape is more sudden, or the atmosphere
more dense; the earthy and metallic particles on the
escape of caloric, will obey the laws of cohesive attraction,
clash together, recover their gravity, and descend to the earth
in masses, or shattered fragments.</p>

<p>Meteoric stones frequently bear the marks of violence, which
is doubtless owing to the conflict sustained at the moment of
explosion; their difference in size depends on the difference
of magnitude in the disploding volumes; something like regular
arrangement is frequently perceived in the structure of
these stones, because in all productions of solid from fluid
matter, the consolidating particles possess a tendency to arrange
themselves in the order of their affinities. It is thus the various
arrangements in saline crystallization, the freezing of
water, and cooling of melted metals, may be accounted for.
There is a real, as well as an apparent difference in the velocity
of meteoric bodies; the first arising from their difference
of magnitude and the violence of the explosion, as well as from
the resistance they meet; the latter, from the different distances
at which they are seen. The gradation of colour, from a
bright silvery hue to a dusky red, is owing, in a certain degree,
to the state of the atmosphere refracting different coloured
rays, and also to the materials in the compound, similar to the
different hues in artificial fireworks. Reddish and white nebicula
are sometimes left in the tracks of meteors, which are
nothing but ignited vapours, or the particles brushed off the
burning body by the resisting atmosphere. The velocity or
motion and direction of meteors, depend upon principles well
known and daily practised by engineers, and the constructors
of fireworks.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of these explosions is a little obscure,
and merits a fuller detail than is compatible with my present
limits; their analogy to the electric phenomena in the clouds,
leaves room to suppose they are effected by certain modifica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>tions
of electricity. Clouds of opposite electricities will approach
each other and explode, by the positive imparting as
much electrical fire to the negative cloud as will make them
equal, when just as much water as the imparted fire held in
solution, will be set at liberty and descend to the earth. If,
however, this solution be deemed inapplicable, perhaps the
following may be admitted. Thus, when heat is urged upon
incombustible<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> bodies with a force that overcomes the cohesive
property by which their particles are tied together, it
unites with them in large quantities, and becomes latent, by
which union they are reduced to the state of elastic fluids;
and as it is a universal property of heat to counteract the gravitating
force of bodies, these compounds must necessarily become
volant, and ascend as above stated. It is only thermometrical
or sensible heat, that destroys the attraction of cohesion
existing between the particles of bodies, the repulsive
power of latent heat being barely able to counteract this property,
when the elements under its dominion are removed beyond
a certain distance from each other; now the very reduced
temperature in the high regions to which these gaseous
clouds will ascend, may admit their earthy and metallic particles
within the sphere of cohesive or aggregative attraction,
when the caloric will be expelled like water from a sponge,
accompanied by all the phenomena above stated.</p>

<p>The third general head of my subject leads me to inquire
into the constituent principles of meteoric stones: sundry papers
on the analysis of these productions, have been furnished
us by chemists of acknowledged reputation and ability, and in
none of these that I have seen, was there any element described
that had not been previously known. But should it
hereafter be found that air stones contain matters not found on
our globe, the fact will afford no absolute proof of the foreign
origin of these stones, as we are successively discovering
earthy and metallic principles of distinct characters from those
already known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>A portion of one of these stones that fell in the town of Weston,
(Connecticut) examined by the late Dr. Woodhouse, gave
the following results in a hundred parts, viz.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

</table>

<p>"The sulphur was seen by the naked eye distributed through
the silex in round globules the size of a pin's head, after dissolving
the powdered stone in diluted nitric acid."</p>

<p>All specimens of these stones do not afford precisely similar
results, but differ in their constituent elements and relative
proportions; their component parts, however, are to be found
abundantly in schist, schorl, pyrites, pebble, granite, &amp;c. on
which the sun must daily act.</p>

<p>The following facts go to strengthen the above theory, viz.
Meteors are most frequent and stupendous in tropical countries,
where the heat of the sun is most intense; and less frequent
in our climate in the winter and spring, while, and after
the earth has been covered with snow for many weeks in succession;
and they are most frequent in the higher latitudes
towards autumn, after a continuation of hot dry weather: out
of the whole number (179) of shooting stars I have noted during
the last twelve years, 149 appeared between June and
December, inclusive.</p>

<p>If it be said that the specific gravity of meteoric stones being
several times that of water, it is absurd to suppose they can
rise, (if even reduced to the state of gas) to the elevated stations
here assigned them, seeing the vapours of water can ascend
only one or two miles above the earth. To this I reply,
that the doctrine of heat is not yet so thoroughly understood,
as to acquaint us with all its habitudes with natural bodies, but
we infer from analogy, that the more refractory a body is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the fire, the greater in a due ratio is the absolute quantity of
heat required to reduce it to, and retain it in, the state of gas,
and the greater, in a corresponding degree, will be the dilatation
of its particles and decrease of its specific gravity. Hence, if
water reduced to vapour by heat, be capable of assuming an
altitude of two miles, it follows that more refractory substances
reduced to a similar state, will suffer expansion and fugacity in
a due proportion to the quantity of caloric they employ, and
will assume a corresponding elevation, as already inferred under
my first head.</p>

<p>Another objection may be, that though high degrees of heat
affect certain solids as above stated, yet these cannot be sensibly
acted on by such feeble agents as atmospheric air and the
rays of the sun. I answer, if it be admitted that sensible heat
acts on solids in an increasing ratio to its intensity, it follows
that lower degrees, though acting in an inverse ratio to higher,
must affect the same bodies in a conceivable degree at any temperature
above their natural zero:<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and though the heat of
the sun beating on a plane surface for several hours is feeble,
compared with that produced by a burning lens, or air furnace,
yet if it be sufficient to detach from one square foot of the
earth's surface the 104023 part of a grain in twenty-four hours,
the quantity taken from 100 square miles, in the same time
and proportion, would amount to ten pounds, which is abundantly
sufficient for all meteoric phenomena; and the loss to
each square foot, supposing the process to be uninterrupted,
would be no more than one grain in 284 years. When we advert
to the intense heat produced by concentrating a few of
the sun's rays in a burning lens, the whole quantity daily sent
to the earth must strike us forcibly. If collected in a lens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
sufficient magnitude, they might volatilize a space equal to the
state of New-York in a moment of time! As all bodies possess
a limited capacity for heat, does it not follow that there
must be some outlet to its perpetual accession to our globe, or
the earth would soon become so highly ignited as to glow with
the fulgour of a meteor? And may not this outlet be found in
the above described compounds? which serve as conductors
of the surplus of heat from the earth to the higher regions of
the air, where on being freed by displosion, from the grosser
matters incumbering it, it finds a rapid passage to its great
archetype and parent, the <span class="fs70">SUN</span>. Thus his daily waste may be
restored, and an equilibrium, by the return of his own emanated
particles, preserved, between the sun and the earth, and
probably all the planets of our system.</p>

<p>The last consideration I shall offer in favour of the domestic
or earthly origin of meteoric phenomena, is the difficulties
that present to our granting them a foreign one. Though I am
well aware of the respectability of the names which the theory
of moonstones can summon to its support, yet I have always
regarded it as unfounded and unphilosophical for the following
reasons, viz. 1st. Whether the moon has an atmosphere or not,
we will all admit that she has attraction, which must extend to
many thousands of miles from her surface. No projectile force
that we are acquainted with can throw a heavy body 100 miles,
even though no atmospheric, or other resistance than its own
gravity, were present; hence the idea of that force extending
to thousands of miles from the moon's surface, is gratuitous
and nugatory. 2dly. The products of volcanoes bear no similarity
of origin, or kindred resemblance to meteoric stones;
those are lavas of different kinds, pumicestone, scoria, ashes,
&amp;c. these solid masses of matter, with some degree of regularity
in the arrangement of their constituent particles. 3dly.
The descent of these stones has no coincidence in point of
time with the position of the moon. She is as often in their
nadir as their zenith. We also witness in all cases, explosion
and light in our own atmosphere, at the time of the descent of
these stones. This could not be the case if they proceeded
from the moon, for obvious reasons. 4thly. The heat ade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>quate
to such projectile force as would carry a body from the
moon's surface beyond the sphere of her attraction, would volatilize
the matter of meteoric stones in a moment; hence they
would not be projected from the Lunarian crater in solid masses,
but in elastic vapour.</p>

<p>In conclusion, although the theory which I have endeavoured
to elucidate and establish, be subject to some difficulties
and objections which science may hereafter remove, it appears
to me perfectly consonant with the relative dependence
and harmony of our system, and by no means at variance with
the infinite wisdom and power by which it was originated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Dear Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="fs200">W</span>ith pleasure, I acknowledge the receipt of the circular
letter bearing date the 5th instant, which you addressed to me,
for which you will be pleased to accept my warmest acknowledgments
for yourself personally, and the Philosophical Society
of which you are the president. To answer all the questions
which are put to me in that letter, is not at present within
my limited means, either as it respects the leisure or the
ability. I shall therefore, at this time, confine myself to "observations
upon the prevailing currents of air in the state of
Ohio."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> These observations will be wholly founded on personal
experience, during the four years in which I have traversed
this state, from Lake Erie to the Ohio river, whilst attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
on the several courts, in all seasons and in all the
changes of weather.</p>

<p>The prevailing currents of air, one of which generally obtains
in Ohio, are three.</p>

<p>The first comes from the Mexican Gulf, ascending the
Mississippi and its larger tributary branches quite to their
very sources.</p>

<p>The second proceeds from the back of mountains to the
west, descends the Missouri to its mouth, and then spreads
over a vast extent of country.</p>

<p>The third comes down the great northern and northwestern
lakes to the south end of Lake Michigan and the
southern shore of Lake Erie, where it spreads over the region
of country lying to the south of them.</p>

<p>That current of air which comes from the Mexican Gulf,
is warmer, and perhaps more moist, than any other which prevails
here. After a few days prevalence, it uniformly brings
rain along with it. That this current of air should be very
warm may be readily conceived, when we reflect that it comes
from a hot tropical region; and that it should be very moist,
excites no surprise, when it is considered, that in its passage
upwards it passes wholly over water, and through the warm
mists and fogs constantly ascending from the Mississippi and
its tributaries. This current prevails much more along the
Ohio river than it does at any considerable distance from it.
One consequence is, that the climate in the immediate vicinity
of the Ohio river is warmer, than it is either north or south
of it, unless you go to the southward a considerable distance.
Other causes may, and probably do, in a greater or less degree,
contribute to produce this result, and I will here state them:</p>

<p>First, The Ohio runs on a surface less elevated above the
sea than the country, either north or south of it, but this difference
is trifling through the whole of the sandstone formation.
This formation prevails from the head of the Ohio to
Aberdeen, which is opposite to Marysville in Kentucky, at least
two-thirds of the distance which that river washes the southern
shore of this state. The reason is obvious, because there are
no falls in a sandstone formation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Another cause which contributes to produce a warmer climate,
especially in the winter season, in the valley of the
Ohio, is, that several considerable streams which empty themselves
into the Ohio, have their sources on the highlands, a
great distance to the south of it; for instance, the Great and
Little Sandy, and the Great and Little Kenhawa, which descending
from a warm region of country, their waters contribute
to keep the Ohio open in winter.</p>

<p>But these causes are by no means sufficient to produce the
one half of the comparative warmth of climate observable in
the immediate vicinity of this invaluable river. To prove
that the climate is much milder in the southern than in the
northern part of this state, I will proceed to mention several
facts, which have fallen under my own observation.</p>

<p>In the latter part of last February I was at the town of
Delaware, on the Whetstone Branch of the Scioto river, between
eighty and ninety miles south of Lake Erie, and twenty-five
miles north of Columbus, the seat of government, which
is near the centre of the state, where I saw a number of gentlemen
direct from Detroit, by the way of Lower Sandusky,
who informed me that the snow at that time was eighteen
inches in depth and upwards all along the lake shore, but
gradually decreased as they came south until they arrived at
Delaware. At that place it was then about twelve inches
deep in the open fields, and somewhat deeper in the woods.
I descended the road along the Whetstone to Columbus, the
snow decreasing in depth all the way as I proceeded. At
Columbus it wholly disappeared in the fields, and only ice was
found in the road, which also decreased until I came to the
Big Walnut Creek, thirteen miles south of Columbus, where
it disappeared, and the road began to be muddy. As I still
proceeded south, the mud increased in depth until I came to
Chillicothe, about thirty-two miles south of Big Walnut,
where the frost was entirely out of the ground, and the roads
were almost impassable. As I still descended southward,
along the Scioto, I found that at Piketon, on the Scioto, nineteen
miles south of Chillicothe, the road had considerably
improved. I proceeded onwards to Portsmouth on the Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
river, at the mouth of the Scioto, about twenty-six miles south
of Piketon, where the ground was entirely settled, and the
innkeeper, where I lodged, was making his garden, sowing his
sallad seed, and planting his peas. This journey was performed
in three days, and in travelling only one hundred and
fifteen miles from north to south, this extraordinary difference
of climate was observed.</p>

<p>A traveller may leave Portsmouth when the farmer is beginning
to hoe his corn the first time, and travel with good
speed to Delaware, and find the husbandman just beginning to
plant.</p>

<p>Instances which have fallen within my own personal observation
might be multiplied to a great extent, but a few may
suffice.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, there is a difference in the beginning
and ending of the warm season of about two weeks between
Portsmouth and Delaware, or of three weeks between the
former place and Lower Sandusky.</p>

<p>In relation to the warmth of the climate, I will state two
other facts, originating, as I believe, in the prevalence of the
southern current of air from the Mexican Gulf along the Ohio
river.</p>

<p>First, In the summer months the paroquet ascends the
Scioto more than one hundred miles from its mouth, and until
within a few years past, wintered at Miller's Bottom, and at
other places along the banks of the Ohio, near its great
southern bend in latitude 38° north, in Gallia and Lawrence
counties, in the state of Ohio. I have seen them there
in all the winter months in considerable numbers, but few
however now winter there; and probably if the cold northwestern
current of air from the great lakes becomes more and
more prevalent in the winter months, these birds will migrate
altogether to a more southern clime.</p>

<p>Are these birds found as far to the north on the east side of
the Alleghany by at least three degrees? Monsieur Volney,
Mr. Jefferson, and others, say not. It has been denied that
this fact proves any thing more than that this bird frequented
these parts in quest of its favourite food. This food is grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and other vegetable matter in summer, and the cockle bur,
and the balls of button-wood, or, as by a perversion of language,
it is called in this country sycamore.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But this bird
may find its favourite food as well east as west of the Alleghanies.
The grasses and trees alluded to, flourish as I have
observed in forty-five degrees of north latitude, and I am
credibly informed that they are abundant as far north as
Quebec, and even around Hudson's Bay. Wherever waters
run and trees grow on their banks, (if low and wet,) on the
American continent, even as high as eighty degrees of north
latitude, there the paroquet may find its food in abundance.</p>

<p>Another fact tending to establish the same point is, that the
reed cane, before this country was much settled, grew in a
higher latitude by several degrees on this than it did on the
other side of the Alleghany mountains. It has indeed been
said, that this cane was never found north of the Ohio, nor
above the mouth of the Big Sandy River, which empties into
the Ohio, on the line which separates Virginia and Kentucky.
This however is incorrect; for within a few years it was growing
in abundance at Miller's Bottom, twenty-six miles above
the mouth of Big Sandy. It grew at Lancaster, on the Hockhocking,
northward of the mouth of the Big Sandy, in a direct
line, at least one hundred and fifty miles, and it now grows on
the Whetstone branch of the Scioto, more than two degrees of
latitude above the lowest bend of the Ohio, which is at the
mouth of the Big Sandy. Before the white people settled
there, I have every reason to believe, that the cane grew in
great plenty at Delaware, where there are more signs of buffaloes
than at any other place within my knowledge. It has
been conjectured, that the seed of the cane was brought down
and scattered by the Big Sandy; but granting this, in what way
could that stream carry this seed up the Hockhocking and
Scioto to their sources? to places several hundred feet above
the highest freshes ever known in this country? With a knowledge
of these facts, cast your eye at the map of Ohio. Proofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
within my reach might be multiplied to a much greater extent,
but they are probably unnecessary.</p>

<p>But another current of air prevails here, especially in the
cold months, coming from the mouth of the Missouri, which is
a little to the south of west of this place. This current is
colder than the preceding one, and though moist, yet not as
much so as the one already described. It prevails generally
in October and November, before our warm weather is over,
and produces frosts and a chilly dampness, and what I have
observed nowhere else, especially on the east side of the
Alleghanies, it produces a kind of faintness at the breast.</p>

<p>People of delicate habits, coming here from the northern
and eastern states, uniformly complain of this faintness. It is
not perhaps extraordinary that this current of air should be
cold, proceeding as it does from a high northern latitude,
along the great chain of rocky mountains in the northwest;
that it should be moist, and perhaps also that it should affect
the animal economy unpleasantly, may possibly be attributed to
its passing such a length of way over the waters of the
Missouri, and the wet prairies and barrens lying so extensively
between us and the head waters of that stream. The
luxuriant vegetation which covers these prairies and barrens
at that season of the year, begins to putrefy, and fills with unhealthy
exhalations every gale of wind which passes over
them.</p>

<p>At the mouth of this river (Missouri,) which is in about latitude
38° north, this current of air is extremely cold in the
winter months. It diverges from this point, and produces extreme
cold at a considerable distance to the south of it on the
Mississippi river. General Rector, the present surveyor general
of the United States, who keeps his office at St. Louis,
informs, that he has known the Mississippi at St. Genevieve,
in latitude about 37°, so firmly covered with ice in one night,
as to be able to bear horses and cattle the ensuing day. This
circumstance must have been owing to the sudden change of
the current of air from south to the northwest, descending
the Missouri river from the cold regions at its sources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>From several gentlemen, residents for many years in Illinois
and Missouri Territories, I have been informed, that changes
of weather in that region of country are, especially in winter,
very frequent and great; that one day the moist south wind
from the Mexican gulf will prevail, and produce quite warm
and mild weather for the season; on the very next, or frequently
in the latter part of the same, the current of air from
the sources of the Missouri will prevail, and block up the
streams with ice.</p>

<p>There is a third current of air which prevails during our
winter months, more and more, annually, as the country becomes
cleared of its forests in the direction alluded to; it proceeds
from the great lakes to the northwest of us, and even beyond
them. Proceeding as it does from the north and northwest
of lake Superior, and crossing the great expanse of water
in this direction, it rushes down these great lakes to the south
end of lake Michigan in latitude about 41° north, diverges from
that point, and spreads over the immense regions lying to the
south, where the air is more rarefied by reason of its warmer
climate. This current of air brings along with it intense cold,
and extended last winter even to New-Orleans, where the snow
fell to such a depth, that sleighs were seen passing in every
part of the city. The more the forests are cleared away between
any place in this country and the northern lakes, the more
this cold current of air will prevail. This current also diverges
from the southern shore of Lake Erie, but is not so strong as
that part of it which diverges from the south end of Michigan,
and of course does not extend as far to the south. When this
part of this state was first settled, this current of air was hardly
felt at this place, and then only for a short time in the winter
months, and hardly ever reached the Ohio river; but last winter
it continued three weeks at one time, and produced good
sleighing; and also caused rheumatisms, pleurisies, peripneumonies,
&amp;c. which proved mortal to some. In this place,
which is in latitude about 39° 20′ north, the thermometer of
Fahrenheit, hanging in an entry of a dwelling-house with closed
doors, sunk to 24 degrees below zero. This extreme cold may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
be attributed to general, rather than to local causes, and it may
be said that the winters all over the world have been colder
of late years than formerly. But on the very day, when it
was thus cold, (if newspapers can be believed) a great number
of vessels put to sea from Reedy Island in the Delaware
below Philadelphia, and about thirty sail of vessels went to
sea from New-York harbour.</p>

<p>All our streams were at the same time bridged with ice of
great firmness as well as thickness, and continued to be so for
a considerable time afterward, until the warmer current of air
from the south prevailed over the current from the lakes. It
will be proper, and may be necessary, here to state, that the
latitudes of several places in this country are very different
from what you would be led to believe from examining any
map or chart now or ever in existence. For instance, Lake
Michigan extends farther south than Fort Wayne, which place
by actual survey is in this state; St. Louis is not 38°, and the
most southern point or bend of the Ohio river, is not more than
latitude 38° north. I state merely what I am informed of by
those who have ascertained these facts by actual observation
and survey. The place opposite the mouth of the Big Sandy,
is nearly as for south as Lexington in Kentucky. The south
end of Michigan lake ought to be laid down on the map 41°
north. Prevailing currents of air (not every breath of air
which moves over the surface) I have attempted to describe.
It may be well enough, however, to mention some other currents
which sometimes prevail for a few days. And here I
will mention what our oldest settlers along the Ohio have observed,
that is, that whenever in a dry time, there is a current
of air proceeding down the river for three or four days in succession,
the current from the Gulf of Mexico is sure to drive it
back with redoubled force, and after blowing a day or two, it
is equally sure to bring rain with it. It is easy to assign a
cause for it; for meeting the trade winds in the Gulf, it is driven
back with redoubled violence to the sources of the larger
streams which empty themselves into the Gulf.</p>

<p>When a thunder storm, proceeding in either a western or
eastern direction, as the case may be, happens to strike a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
water-course running either north or south, and when also
there happens to be a large branch emptying into the stream,
within a few miles either above or below the point where the
storm approaches it, I have uniformly observed the storm to
cross the large stream at the point where the large branch
unites with it, and ascend the branch. Where there are two
large tributaries about equi-distant from the point of approach,
the storm frequently divides and follows each of them. The
reason why it should be so, this is not the place to discuss;
but the Wisdom and Goodness which so ordered it, are too apparent
to every rational mind to be overlooked. It may be
asked if the difference in latitude and elevation between the
Ohio and lake regions of country, does not produce a great difference
in the climates of those respective regions? These
causes certainly produce some difference, but not all. It is
my object to establish facts, rather than any favourite theory.
The difference of latitude between the Ohio river at the mouth
of the Scioto, and lake Erie at the mouth of the Maume or
Sandusky, is nearly three degrees, and the difference of elevation
above the sea is trifling, if any. From the mouth of the
Scioto to Columbus, about 90 miles in a direct line, the water,
where there is what is commonly called a <em>ripple</em>, runs briskly,
and these ripples happen, perhaps, one to a mile; but they are
in a sandstone region, and the fall of course is trifling.</p>

<p>Let us suppose then, that the river Scioto descends one
hundred feet from the mouth of the Whetstone, which empties
into that river at Columbus, to the Ohio, and that the Whetstone
which runs through a limestone formation, descends another
hundred feet, which would make Upper Sandusky two
hundred feet higher than the Ohio river. From this highest
ground between the Ohio and the lake, it is a well-known fact,
that the land descends towards the north much more in a given
distance, than it does towards the south, and the distance is not
half as far. The Maume and other streams putting into the
lake, are full of rapids. Admitting for argument's sake, that
the Sandusky or Maume descend only 100 feet, then the surface
of the lake is 100 feet higher than the Ohio river. Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
three degrees of latitude, and 100 feet greater elevation produce
three weeks difference in the seasons? Is there that difference
between Baltimore in Maryland, and Wilkesbarre in
Pennsylvania? Is there that difference between New-York
and Fort Edward on the Hudson? It is believed that there is
not one half that difference.</p>

<p>I have referred but little to thermometers, because they are
kept in so many different situations by their owners, that I
have known no less than 8 degrees of difference between several
of them kept in one town, within almost a stone's throw
of each other, at one and the same moment of time.</p>

<p>Every allowance being made for other causes, I am still of
the opinion that the difference in the climates of the Ohio and
lake regions of country, is to be attributed chiefly to the prevalence
of different currents of air. The southern current
rarely, if ever, reaches the northern lakes, and the northern,
until lately, never reached the Gulf of Mexico. But as the
country is cleared of its native forests, we may reasonably
conclude this cold current of air will prevail more and more,
until we shall have snow enough for sleighs, at least two months
in every winter; the summers will be shorter, the extremes of
heat and cold will be greater than at present, and those clouds
which formerly obscured the sun almost continually during the
summer months, will be chased away, and with them the pale
cheek, the sallow hue, the oppression at the breast, and the
difficulty of respiration, the headache, and the thousand ills
which many of the first emigrants have experienced in our
climate. We shall probably then have fewer diseases, and
more acute ones. The storms will probably be fewer, more
severe, and not continue as long as at present. There are still
further views which might be taken of this subject, but they
are left to abler pens and future observations.</p>

<p>Thus I have endeavoured to give my opinion on a subject
of some interest to the present, as well as future generations;
in doing which, I have not sought for flowers which might have
been gathered by stepping out of my path, but the <em>fruit</em> rather
of my own observation and experience: I have not wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>

<p class="p1 pfs70">(With a Plate.)</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>To the Editor of the American Journal of Science, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="fs200">I</span> have lately examined a singular disruption in the earth,
discovered a few days since in the northerly part of an extensive
meadow in this town, about ten rods from Deerfield river.</p>

<p>The soil on the spot is alluvial, consisting of a dry, rich,
vegetable mould, with a large intermixture of sand; and the
field, elevated 14 feet above the bed of the river, is annually
mowed. A valley encircles the ruptured spot on the east,
south, and west, only five feet lower, yet so marshy and soft,
as to render draining necessary to make it passable; and immediately
back of this valley, on the south, rises a hill 100 feet
high, at whose foot are several springs. North of the rupture,
also, between it and the river, is a gradual descent of three
feet: indeed, the ground slopes from it on every side except
the northwest.</p>

<p>A fissure one inch wide and fourteen deep, forming an almost
perfect ellipsis, whose diameters are 9 and 5½ rods, marks the
exterior limit of the convulsion. Within this curve are several
others nearly concentric to it, some forming a quarter, and
some half an ellipsis, and near the longer axis are others, running
in various directions. On this transverse diameter, which lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
near the highest part of the swell above described, and in its
longest direction, or parallel to the river, the greatest effect
of the convulsion appears. The earth, to the depth it has
frozen the past winter, 14 inches, is broken on a straight line
above 6 rods, and the south edge of the fissure, having been
forced up, overlaps the other, three feet. Where one edge
does not thus overreach, the tables of earth, which at a small
distance resemble masses of ice, are raised up so that their faces
form an isosceles triangle, leaving a cavity beneath. About
the extremities of the transverse axis, is also an overlapping of
two feet, which continues nearly two rods on the curve each
way from the axis, and in most places is double, overreaching
internally and externally, exhibiting likewise, some irregularity
where the compressing forces acted at right angles to each
other. The edges of these elevated masses of earth, which
are yet frozen, are quite smooth, and the angles but little fractured.
I have dug into the earth about four feet underneath
the longer axis of the ellipsis, and thrust down a bar in other
places, but cannot perceive that the soil has been moved below
where it was frozen. It is, however, not the most favourable
season for ascertaining this fact.</p>

<p>Every appearance on the spot will justify this conclusion,
that the frozen surface of the earth around, has pressed with
great force <em>from every direction</em> to this ellipsis as a centre; for,
were every fissure in the ellipsis to be filled by replacing the
earth, there must remain on its longer axis and at the extremities
of this, an overplus of surface two feet wide.</p>

<p>The month of February last has been unusually cold. Its
mean temperature in Deerfield, by Fahrenheit's scales, is as
follows.</p>

<p>The extremes were 25° below, and 49° above zero. On
the last day but one of the month, the cold suddenly relaxed;
and on the 1st and 2d of March, a heavy and warm rain succeeded.
This produced an uncommon rise in Deerfield river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and on the 3d of March, it had overflowed the ground where
the above described phenomenon occurred, and did not recede
from it for 24 hours. Its greatest depth there, was five feet.
The snow was nearly one foot deep when the flood happened,
and being a nonconductor of heat, the temperature of the surface
of the ground was not probably much changed from its
state in February, until the water came in contact with it. It
may not be amiss to give the state of the thermometer on the
last of February and beginning of March.</p>

<p>On the third of March, about sunset, some lads were sailing
near the spot where the disruption appears, and saw the water
in considerable agitation, with much bubbling, and at short intervals
it was thrown up in several places to the height of 3
or 4 feet. They saw no rupture in the earth, although they
came within two or three rods of the spot, and state the water
to have been two feet deep. About one o'clock on the morning
of March 4th, Mr. Seth Sheldon and family, living one mile
south from this spot, and being awake, were alarmed by a loud
report from the north, by which their house and furniture were
much shaken. They compared the sound, though louder by
far than they had ever heard from this cause, to that of a
cracking in the earth by frost in severe weather. Some others
living rather nearer the spot, were awakened by the same report.
That the rupture in the earth was made at that time is
probable, though not certain.</p>

<p>It may be proper to state, that during the flood, no ice, except
a few loose masses, was carried over, or near the spot
where the disruption appears. This, therefore, could not
have produced it.</p>

<p>These are all the facts I am able at present to collect concerning
this phenomenon. I have been particular as to the
temperature of the air, and the situation of the adjacent country,
from an idea that frost was a principal agent in producing
it; and that, therefore, these circumstances would be important
in fixing a theory. I will not, however, hazard any hypothesis

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Since I sent you a description of a singular disruption in
the earth in this town, another has been observed in the same
meadows, about one mile from the former. This is less than
the one of which I sent you an account, but its situation is almost
exactly similar; it being on a small elevation, on the sides
of which, at a few rods distant, is low wet ground. Indeed,
the <em>general</em> description which I sent you will answer for this
smaller disruption. The diameters of this last, are only 7 and
8 paces, and the curve is not perfect. There appears to have
been an expansion of the earth's surface around both these
spots, or disruptions, by which it was forced to give way at the
point where there was the least resistance, which, of course,
would be on the highest ground. The more I observe of this
phenomenon, the more I am inclined to impute it to the agency
of frost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be proper to observe, that in neither of these disruptions
has the general mass of the hills sunk in the least. Had
this been the case, it might perhaps have accounted for them.
It is also certain, that the soil below where it was frozen the
past winter, has not been moved. I mentioned this fact in my
first communication, though with some suggested doubt.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs70">REMARKS.</p>

<p>An opinion having been requested by Mr. Hitchcock on the
above facts, it may be observed, that there appears in the statement
sufficient evidence that the phenomenon (as the author
has suggested) is attributable to frost.</p>

<p>It is a fact, established equally by common experience and
by numerous experiments, that water, in freezing, expands.
It is generally estimated that 8 cubic inches of water, become
9 by the act of congealing. The expansion is attributed, with
sufficient evidence, to a crystalline arrangement arising from a
kind of polarity in the particles of water exerted when they are
near congealing, by which they attract one another in certain
points, and not in others. Dr. Black, with his usual felicity,
has illustrated this tendency, by supposing a great number of
small magnetized needles, thrust through corks, so that they
will float parallel to the surface of water, to be thrown promiscuously
into a vessel of that fluid. They will not remain
in the situation in which they are thrown in, but, in consequence
of their polarity, attractions and repulsions will be
immediately exerted; they will rush together, with a force
equal to the overcoming of a certain resistance; they will arrange
themselves in pairs and groups, and finally, in a connected
assemblage.</p>

<p>The particles of water attract each other with a prodigious
force, when resistance is opposed; for it is well known that
domestic utensils, trees, rocks, and even cannon, and bomb-shells,
are burst with explosion, when water confined within
them is frozen.</p>

<p>There is force enough then exerted by the expansion of
freezing water, to produce all the mechanical violence, whose
effects were so striking in the instance at Deerfield.</p>

<p>In the common cracking of the ground by frost, so extensively
observed in cold climates, the effect appears to result in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the following manner. The water contained in the ground,
(that is, in that part which is within the reach of a freezing
temperature) by congealing, expands and demands more space;
a movement must necessarily take place in the direction where
there is the least resistance; this will evidently be upward,
because the atmosphere, the only counteracting power in this
direction, cannot resist the expansion of the freezing water as
much as it is resisted by the earth below the freezing stratum.
Consequently, the freezing earth is forced upward, but being
of unequal strength in different places, it cracks at the weakest
spot; and the earth, for some distance on the sides of the fissure,
is thrown into the position of two planes gently inclined, their
relative position resembling that of a very flat roof, and the
more they are lifted by frost, the more they will decline from
one another, and the wider will be the fissure.</p>

<p>But why, in the instance which Mr. Hitchcock has related,
did they overlap? The explanation appears to result from the
circumstances of the case, as far as they can be understood
without ocular inspection of the ground.</p>

<p>The elevated spot which cracked in so remarkable a manner,
being nearly surrounded by a <em>belt</em> of low wet ground, the congelation
of the water in this ground by the intense cold, would
of course produce a very great expansive effort towards the
elevated ground. This, not only on account of its elevation,
but from its containing less water, would not be able to exert
an equal counteracting effort. The surface of the ground,
therefore, (without at all disturbing the unfrozen earth below,)
was, by the expansive effort of the freezing water, <em>pushed along</em>
towards the elevated spot. This spot being possessed of a
certain power of resistance derived from its gravity, and from
the freezing of the water in it, would not immediately give
way; but the whole surface, it is probable, gradually rose for
some time, while the expansion was going on and increasing.
A cavity would thus be produced between that superficial
layer of frozen ground which was rising, and the unfrozen
ground below. This cavity would of course be filled with air
derived from the atmosphere, and from the porousness of the
ground below. When the place came to be overflowed, water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
would immediately rush in through any fissure, and this hydraulic
and hydrostatic effort would force the air out at any
orifice, and thus blow the water up with it. This was probably
the cause of the agitation of the water, and of the bubbling
of air, and of the throwing up of the water at intervals, observed
by the boys on the 3d of March.</p>

<p>The effect of the water covering the ground, would be to
weaken its cohesion derived from frost, and as there were probably
hundreds of tons of pressure, the vaulted ground, when
sufficiently weakened, gave way with a loud explosion and a
violent concussion, as heard by Mr. Sheldon's family, a few
hours after the facts observed by the boys. The parts of the
arch now fallen in, (so to speak) necessarily either overlapped,
or rose in ridges, piece being pressed against piece, as described
and figured by Mr. Hitchcock.</p>

<p>We are indebted to this gentleman for his delineation of this
singular case.</p>

<p>The freezing of water, and its attendant expansion, are productive
of multiplied and very diversified phenomena upon our
globe, whether we contemplate them in the delicate spiculæ of
hoarfrost, the six-rayed stars of snow, or in the stupendous
glaciers of the Alps, and the awful icebergs of Greenland.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he Electrical Battery in its common form is an unmanageable
and inconvenient apparatus. When the coated surface is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
comparatively small, the instrument occupies a large space,
and it cannot be readily removed from place to place without
much trouble and risk; the apparatus is, moreover, very expensive,
and when one of the jars is broken, another of the
same dimensions cannot readily be found to supply its place.</p>

<p>It occurred to me, that a Battery might be constructed of
plates of glass and sheets of tinfoil, in which the same extent
of coated surface should occupy a much smaller space, and
consequently that the apparatus would be more convenient
and more portable. I selected several panes of glass, the
surfaces of which coincided closely with each other, and then
arranged them with sheets of tinfoil in this order, viz. pane
of glass, sheet of tinfoil, then another pane of glass, then a
second sheet of tinfoil, and so on; the sheets of foil being
smaller than the plates of glass by two inches all around; the
glass being 10 by 12, and the foil 6 by 8. This apparatus
contained six plates of tinfoil, and the lowest plate being numbered
<em>one</em>, was connected with the ground, and by slips of tinfoil
passing over the edges, with the <em>third</em> plate, and this, in
like manner with the <em>fifth</em>. The <em>second</em> plate was connected
with the <em>fourth</em>, and this with the <em>sixth</em>, which communicated
with the conductor of the machine; in this manner each plate
positively electrified will be opposed by one negatively electrified,
and vice versa; the 6th, 4th, and 2d plates positive, and
the 5th, 3d, and 1st, negative. Into this apparatus I could introduce
a powerful charge, but not possessing a battery of the
common form, could not make comparative experiments. The
annexed figures will explain the construction of this apparatus.</p>

<p>In a battery of the ordinary form, it is evident that a much
less surface is coated than in one of the above construction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
in a battery of the common form, two feet long, one foot wide,
and ten inches high, and containing 18 coated jars, there will
be no more than 3500 square inches of coated surface, while
in a battery of the same dimensions on the proposed construction,
there will be no less than 8000 square inches covered
with tinfoil, allowing the sheet of glass and of foil to be ¼ inch
thick.</p>

<p>When plate glass is employed for making this battery, the
ring of glass exterior to the tinfoil may be covered with varnish,
and then the next plate laid over it; the tinfoil will then
be shut out for ever from the access of moisture, and the insulation
will remain perfect. This form of the Electrical Battery
is very portable, may be packed in a case with the machine,
and indeed a powerful battery occupies no greater space than
a quarto volume. It is cheap and easily constructed.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he myrtle wax of commerce has been examined by Dr.
Bostock and by M. Cadet; the entire berry not having been
made the subject of analysis, I have been induced to examine
it, with a view to ascertain the proportion of wax.</p>

<p>I. Fifty grains of the most perfect berries were digested in
repeated portions of warm alcohol, until the fluid appeared to
exert no further action. The first portions of alcohol were
tinged of a green colour, but the last portions remained colourless.</p>

<p>II. The alcoholic solutions were poured into a small retort
of known weight; the alcohol was carefully distilled off, and
the residuum dried; deducting the weight of the retort, there
remained 18.5 grs. for the weight of the matter dissolved by
the alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>III. The substances which had been dissolved by the alcohol
consisted of two portions, viz. the wax, which was of an
apple-green colour, and a reddish brown substance; this substance
was supposed to be resinous, and the contents of the
retort were therefore digested in acetic acid; the acid soon
became of a reddish brown colour, and dissolved nearly the
whole of the matter in the retort, leaving the wax. The acid solution,
together with a small portion of insoluble reddish matter,
were carefully separated from the wax. The wax being
dried and melted, weighed 16 grains.</p>

<p>IV. The acetic acid solution was evaporated to dryness,
and a dark brown matter was obtained; it was almost totally
soluble in warm alcohol, from which it was precipitated by
water; it was supposed therefore to consist chiefly of resin,
with a small portion of extractive matter, and may be called
resino-extractive; it weighed 2.5 grains.</p>

<p>V. The matter insoluble in alcohol consisted of two parts,
viz. the kernels and a fine-grained black powder, having very
much the appearance of fine gunpowder; the powder was
carefully separated from the kernels by a wire sieve, and
weighed 7.5 grains. The kernels were found to weigh 23.75
grains.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">O</span>ne hundred parts exposed to a red heat in a platina crucible
lost 18.5, acquired an umber brown colour, and a degree
of hardness sufficient to scratch glass.</p>

<p>One hundred parts reduced to fine powder were mixed with
four times the weight of soda, and exposed to heat, gradually
increased for three quarters of an hour; at the expiration of
which time, the whole had acquired a pasty consistence. The
crucible was now removed from the fire, its outer surface
carefully wiped. Muriatic acid was poured on till all effervescence
ceased. The solution obtained was evaporated to dryness,
gradually assuming an orange red colour. Water was
now poured upon the mass, after which it was filtered, and the
powder remaining carefully dried; after ignition, and while
warm, it weighed 28 parts. This powder was insoluble in
muriatic acid, and of a white colour.</p>

<p>To the filtered solution, reduced by evaporation, carbonate
of potash was added, the precipitate was collected on a filter,
washed and dried; it weighed 23 parts. This powder was
redissolved in sulphuric acid, sulphate of potash added, and
crystals of alum finally obtained; hence this powder was
alumine. To the liquor from which the silex and alumine
had thus been separated, acetic acid was added; the whole
evaporated to dryness; the excess of acid being removed, a
small quantity of water was poured on, and after strong ignition,
the precipitate weighed 4.5.</p>

<p>Into a very small tubulated retort I introduced a portion
from the same mass, whence the piece submitted to analysis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
was broken, and obtained over mercury the carbonic acid in
the usual manner. This was equal to 2.32; by deducting this
from 18.5 the loss during exposure to red heat, we shall have
16.18, the proportion of water. The oxide of iron was separated
from the solutions after the addition of acetic acid, by
ammonia, and weighed 26 parts.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>n a good season an acre of suitable land well cultivated
will produce 400 bushels of potatoes. In Woodbridge, a town
adjoining New-Haven, a crop of 600 bushels of potatoes has
been obtained from a single acre. A bushel of potatoes
weighs 56 pounds. Multiply 400, the number of bushels, by
56, the weight of a single bushel, gives 22400, the number of
pounds of potatoes produced upon one acre.</p>

<p>Thirty bushels of wheat are considered a good crop as the
product of one acre of land. About ⅚ of wheat may be considered
as nutritious matter.</p>

<p>According to the experiments of Dr. Pearson and Einhoff,
about one-third of the potato is nutritious matter. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
analysis of Einhoff, 7680 parts of potatoes afforded 1153 parts
of starch&mdash;fibrous matter analogous to starch 540 parts&mdash;albumen
107 parts&mdash;mucilage 312 parts. The sum of these products
amounts to about one-third of the potatoes subject to the
experiment.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy observes, that one-fourth of the weight
of potatoes at least may be considered nutritious matter.</p>

<p>One-fourth of 22400, the product of an acre of ground, cultivated
with potatoes, is 5600. The whole weight of a crop
of wheat calculated at 30 bushels to the acre, and at 60 pounds
to the bushel, gives 1800. Deducting one-sixth from the wheat
as matter not nutritious, and the weight is reduced to 1500.</p>

<p>The nutritious matter of the crop of potatoes to that of
wheat is as 5600 to 1500, or as 56 to 15.</p>

<p>The starch might be obtained by a very simple machine,
recommended by Parmentier; and in seasons when potatoes
are abundant, the potatoes might be converted to starch, and
the starch preserved for any length of time, and used as a
substitute for wheaten flour.</p>

<p>The machine alluded to is a cylinder of wood about three
feet long and six inches in diameter, covered with sheet tin,
punched outward so as to form a coarse grater, and turned by
a crank. This cylinder is placed in a box of boards whose
sides slope a little inward upon the principle of a hopper, and
a tub of water is placed beneath: The potatoes are thrown
into this box, and as the crank is turned they are crushed, and
the starch or fecula subsides to the bottom of the water. It
is well known, that potatoes are largely used in England
mixed with flour to form a very good bread; the <em>starch</em> of the
potato would of course answer much better.</p>

<p class="pfs70">(Communicated.)</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">D</span>octor Archibald Bruce, (the subject of this Memoir)
was a native of the city of New-York, in North America. He
was born in the month of February, in the year seventeen
hundred and seventy-seven. His father was, at that time, at
the head of the medical department of the British army, (then
stationed at New-York) to which he had been attached from
his youth, having been many years previously resident at New-York,
as surgeon to the artillery department; where he was
married, in or about the year seventeen hundred and sixty-seven,
to Judith, a daughter of Nicholas Bayard, formerly of
the same city, at that time the widow of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer
of Greenbush; by whom he had another son, (who died
an officer in the British army in Ireland) and a daughter, who
died while a child.</p>

<p>William Bruce, (the father above-mentioned,) and his brother
Archibald, together with a sister, were natives of the town
of Dumfries in Scotland, where their father was many years
resident as the parochial clergyman; and so continued until
his decease, much respected.</p>

<p>Both sons applied themselves to the science of medicine and
surgery. William, as above stated, became a physician in the
British army, and died, in that station, of the yellow fever, in
the island of Barbadoes. And Archibald received a commission
of surgeon in the British navy, in which he continued until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
disqualified by old age, when he retired from business, and died
a few years since in London. For many years he acted as surgeon
to the several ships commanded by Sir Peter Parker,
captain, and afterward admiral.</p>

<p>Doctor William Bruce, before his final separation from his
family, on the occasion of his being ordered to the West-India
station, had always declared that his son Archibald should never
be educated for the medical profession; and finally enjoined
such instruction upon his wife and friends, to whom the charge
of the boy was committed. After his decease, the same injunction
was repeated by the uncle, then in Europe, who was
ever averse to his nephew's making choice of this profession:
much pains were therefore early exerted to divert him from
such inclination.</p>

<p>The momentous state of political affairs, induced his mother
to send him to Halifax, under the care of William Almon, M. D.
a particular friend of her husband, with whom, however, remaining
but a short time, he returned to New-York; and was
placed at a boarding-school at Flatbush, Long Island, under the
direction of Peter Wilson, LL.D. who was in high standing
as a teacher of the languages.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1791, he was admitted a student of the arts in Columbia
college. Nicholas Romayne, M.D. was at this time among the
physicians of highest consideration in New-York, and was engaged
in delivering lectures on different subjects of medical
science in Columbia College. Having pursued the early part
of his medical studies with Dr. William Bruce, he felt a generous
gratitude for the instruction and attention which he had
received from him, and endeavoured to requite them by advising
with his son, and promoting his views, as far as lay in his
power. Here commenced a friendship which increased with
advancing years, and terminated but with life. At this period,
young Bruce began to evince a desire to oppose the inclination
of his father and friends by studying medicine; this study, without
their knowledge, and while a student of the arts in the
senior class, he commenced by attending Dr. Romayne's lectures.
Such was the strong bent of his mind towards the study
of medicine, and its collateral physical pursuits, that the persuasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>and remonstrances of his friends proved alike ineffectual,
and he soon gave free scope to the prevailing inclination.</p>

<p>The collection and examination of minerals, a pursuit not
then at all attended to in this country, was his particular relief
from other studies; for even during his recreation, he was ever
on the look-out for something new or instructing in mineralogy.</p>

<p>Dr. Romayne being about visiting Europe, young Bruce pursued
his studies with Samuel Bard, M.D.; and having attended
the usual courses in Columbia College, he left the United
States for Europe in 1798, and in 1800 he obtained the degree
of doctor in medicine from the University of Edinburgh, after
defending a Thesis, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Variola Vaccina</span>.</p>

<p>Having now finished his medical studies, he was prepared to
visit the continent of Europe with peculiar advantage; for his
continued attachment to mineralogy, a liberal distribution of
American specimens then comparatively new in Europe, and
his social habits and dispositions, which were very conciliating,
secured him the best introductions from Edinburgh, and laid
the foundation of permanent friendships.</p>

<p>During a tour of two years, he visited France, Switzerland,
and Italy; and collected a mineralogical cabinet of great value
and extent. After his return to England, he married in London,
and came out to New-York in the autumn of 1803, to enter
on the active duties of a practitioner of medicine.</p>

<p>Previous to the year 1805, the practice of physic in the state
of New-York was regulated by no public authority, and of
course was not in the happiest condition to promote the respectability
and usefulness of the profession. To remove, as
far as possible, the existing inconveniences, Dr. Bruce became
an active agent, and in conjunction with Dr. Romayne and
other medical gentlemen of New-York, succeeded in establishing
the state and county medical societies, under the sanction
of the state legislature. This act "may be considered among
the first efforts made in this country to reduce medicine to a
regular science, by investing the privileges of medical men in
the body of the members of the profession."</p>

<p>In the organization of the College of Physicians and Surgeons
of the state of New-York, Dr. Bruce and Dr. Romayne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
were eminently active, and by their united exertion and perseverance,
(opposed by much professional talent) they obtained
a charter from the regents. In this new institution, as professor
of the materia medica, and of his favourite pursuit, mineralogy,
he exhibited the fruits of arduous study, with a dignity
of character, and urbanity of manner, which commanded the
respect of the profession, and the regard of the students.</p>

<p>The ruling passion in Dr. Bruce's mind, was a love of natural
science, and especially of mineralogy. Towards the study of
this science, he produced in his own country a strong impulse,
and he gave it no small degree of eclat. His cabinet, composed
of very select and well characterized specimens; purchased
by himself, or collected in his own pedestrian and other tours
in Europe, or, in many instances, presented to him by distinguished
mineralogists abroad; and both in its extent, and
in relation to the then state of this country, very valuable,
soon became an object of much attention. That of the late
B. D. Perkins, which, at about the same time, had been formed
by Mr. Perkins in Europe, and imported by him into this country,
was also placed in New-York, and both cabinets (for both
were freely shown to the curious, by their liberal and courteous
proprietors) contributed more than any causes had ever
done before, to excite in the public mind an active interest in
the science of mineralogy.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Bruce, while abroad, had been personally and intimately
conversant with the Hon. Mr. Greville, of Paddington Green,
near London, a descendant of the noble house of Warwick, the
possessor of one of the finest private cabinets in Europe, and
a zealous cultivator of mineralogy. Count Bournon, one of
those loyal French exiles, who found a home in England, during
the storm of the French revolution, was almost domesticated
at Mr. Greville's, and was hardly second to any man in
mineralogical, and particularly in crystallographical knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
His connexions with men of science on the continent, were of
the first order, and to be familiar at Mr. Greville's, and with
Count Bournon, was to have access to every thing connected
with science in England and France. Dr. Bruce was also at
home at Sir Joseph Banks's, the common resort of learned and
illustrious men. Thus he enjoyed every advantage in England,
and when he went to the continent, the abundant means of introduction
which he possessed, brought him into contact with
the distinguished men of Paris, and of other cities which he
visited. The learned and estimable Abbé Haüy was among
his personal friends and correspondents; and many others
might be mentioned in the same character, whose names are
among the first in the ranks of science, in various countries of
Europe.</p>

<p>Returned to his own country, after being so long familiar
with the fine collections in natural history, and especially in
mineralogy, in various countries in Europe, Dr. Bruce manifested
a strong desire to aid in bringing to light the neglected
mineral treasures of the United States. He soon became a focus
of information on these subjects. Specimens were sent to
him from many and distant parts of the country, both as donations
and for his opinion respecting their nature. In relation
to mineralogy he conversed, he corresponded extensively, both
with Europe and America; he performed mineralogical tours;
he kindly sought out and encouraged the young mineralogists
of his own country, and often expressed a wish to see a journal
of American mineralogy upon the plan of that of the School of
Mines at Paris. This object, it is well known, he accomplished,
and in 1810, published the first number of this work. Owing
to extraneous causes, it was never carried beyond one volume;
but it demonstrated the possibility of sustaining such a work in
the United States, and will always be mentioned in the history
of American science, as the earliest original purely scientific
journal of America.</p>

<p>Dr. Bruce had, in a high degree, the feelings of a man of science.
He was ever forward to promote its interests, and both
at home and abroad, was considered as one of its most distinguished
American friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Many strangers of distinction came introduced to him, and
his urbanity and hospitality rarely left him without guests at
his board. During the latter part of his life, he seems to have
been less interested in science. His journal had been so long
suspended, that it was considered as virtually relinquished; his
health was undermined by repeated attacks of illness, and science
and society had to lament his sudden departure, when he
had scarcely attained the meridian of life.</p>

<p>He died in his native place on the 22d of February, 1818,
of an apoplexy, in the 41st year of his age.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XIX.</span> &nbsp; 1. <em>Dr.</em> <span class="smcap">J. W. Webster's</span> <em>Lectures</em>.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">D</span>r. J. W. Webster, some months since, commenced a
course of Lectures in the town of Boston, on Geology and
Mineralogy. Having finished his first course, he is now occupied
with a second on the same subjects, and we understand
receives the patronage of some of the most respectable citizens
of Boston and its vicinity. He makes Geology the groundwork
of his plan, and fills up by describing the metals and
minerals met with in each class of rocks, after the rock has
been noticed. A pretty full account is given of the coal formations,
(several of which Dr. W. has visited) and of the
modes of searching and boring. A view is given of the formations
of Paris and the Isle of Wight, with specimens from
those districts.</p>

<p>In the volcanic part, a description (from personal observation)
is given of St. Michael's. The structure of veins; the
forming and destroying effects of water; the physiognomy of
the dry land and submarine; the origin of islands and coral
reefs, and a view of the principal mountain ranges throughout
the world conclude the course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">2. <em>Dr. Webster's Cabinet.</em></p>

<p>Dr. Webster, having spent two or three years in Europe,
in professional studies, during which time he devoted much
attention to mineralogy and geology, with the ample aids
afforded by the cabinets and distinguished teachers in Scotland,
France, and England, has recently returned to his own country,
and has brought with him a very select and considerably
extensive cabinet of minerals, with which, and with American
specimens, he illustrates his lectures. We understand that
the collection contains some thousand specimens, and is good
in the English and Scotch minerals; also in the Siberian coppers;
it contains a suite of three hundred geological specimens
from Freyberg, from granite to gravel. The geological part
is extensive, and was increased by numerous pedestrian tours
in England and Scotland; most of the geological specimens
have been examined, in company with Professor Jameson.
The volcanic part is good, from the extensive opportunities
which Dr. Webster enjoyed in the Azores, in which, on his
return to this country, he spent some time, and found much to
interest him. His observations will soon be given to the public,
in a work entitled <em>Remarks on the Azores or Western Islands</em>.</p>

<p>It is well known that they are volcanic, and of course afford
the usual volcanic substances. The most interesting part is
that occupied by the boiling fountains, in many respects similar
to the Geysers of Iceland, excepting that the water is not
ejected to any considerable height; but the incrustations, the
sinter, and sulphur, are every way equal to any specimens
which Dr. Webster saw in Sir G. Mackenzie's collection.</p>

<p>We are much gratified in noticing both what Dr. Webster
has done and is still doing. We are persuaded that he will
do much towards promoting the cultivation of American mineralogy
and geology, and especially in the enlightened community
in which he resides.</p>

<p>We cordially wish him success, and trust that it will be ensured
by the patronage of the citizens of Boston.</p>

<p class="p1 center">3. <em>Supposed identity of Copal and Amber.</em></p>

<p>A correspondent, whose paper is withheld from publication
till some additional experiments can be made, conceives that
copal and amber are originally the same substance, and the
product of the same tree.</p>


<p class="p1 center">4. <span class="smcap">The Necronite.</span>&mdash;(<em>A supposed new mineral.</em>)</p>

<p class="center"><em>Extract of a letter from Dr. H. H. Hayden of Baltimore, to the
Editor, dated January 5, 1819.</em></p>

<p>"It (the necronite) occurs in a primitive marble, or limestone,
which is obtained 21 miles from Baltimore, and a small
distance from the York and Lancaster road. It was first noticed
by myself at Washington's monument, in which this marble
is principally employed.</p>

<p>"It occurs, for the most part, in isolated masses in the
blocks, or slabs, both in an amorphous and crystallized state.
It is most commonly associated with a beautiful brown mica,
of the colour of titanium; small but regular crystals of sulphuret
of iron, tremolite, and small prismatic crystals of titanium,
which are rare. The form of the crystals is a rhomboid,
approximating very much to that of the felspar, and
which has inclined some to consider it as such. Also, the hexaedral
prism, resembling that of the beryl. This form is rare,
and has not, as yet, I believe, been found complete. Its colour
is a bluish white, and clear white. Its structure much resembles
felspar, being lamellar; sometimes opaque, semi-transparent
and transparent, at least in moderately thin pieces. It
scratches glass, carbonat of lime, and even felspar, in a <em>slight</em>
degree. In all our efforts, it has been found infusible, per se,
or with borate of soda, and even from all the force of heat
that could be excited in a smith's furnace, it came out unchanged
in any degree. The acids seem to have no sensible
effect upon it, either cold or hot. This is all that I can say
of it at present, except that it possesses a most <em>horrid</em> smell.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
I have since found in a marble of the same kind, but from a different
quarry, and a few miles distant from the first, a quartz
almost as fetid as the necronite, and likewise associated with
<em>small</em> prisms of titanium.</p>

<p>"These substances carry with them a degree of interest
in another point of view. They seem to invalidate the
opinion that the fetid smell of secondary limestone, slate, &amp;c.
is derived from the decomposition of animal matter. As their
gangue is <em>decidedly</em> a rock of primitive formation."</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Another new mineral observed by Dr. Hayden.</em></p>

<p>"Exclusive of the interest which the necronite has excited
with me and several others, I have besides stumbled upon
another substance, if possible still more interesting. I discovered
it in an imperfect state, about 4 years since, but not
until recently have I been able to find it perfect, in beautiful
garnet coloured cubic crystals ¼ of an inch square or nearly.
These crystals are very liable or subject to decomposition, in
which state they present a perfect but spongy cube. Although
they resemble the cubic zeolite, yet they have nothing of its
character with them besides."</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Remark.</em></p>

<p>Dr. Hayden without doubt alludes to the <i>chabasie</i> of the
Abbé Haüy, formerly but inaccurately called the cubic zeolite;
for it is really a rhomboid very nearly approaching a cube&mdash;its
angles being 93° 48′, and 86° 12′.</p>


<p class="p1 center">5. <span class="smcap">Preservation of Dead Bodies.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>From Thenard's Chemistry</cite>, vol. iii. <em>Paris ed. p.</em> 713.</p>

<p>The author declines describing the methods of embalming
commonly employed, and proceeds to describe the mode which
was for the first time employed by Dr. Chaussier.</p>

<p>"This process consists in placing the dead body thoroughly
emptied and washed, in water kept constantly saturated with
corrosive sublimate. This salt gradually combines with the
flesh, gives it firmness, renders it imputrescible, and incapable
of being attacked by insects and worms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have seen, (adds the author) a head thus prepared,
which had been exposed alternately to the sun and rain during
several years, without having suffered the slightest change.
It was very little deformed, and easily recognized, although
the flesh had become as hard as wood."</p>


<p class="p1 center">6. <span class="smcap">Matches kindling without fire.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<cite>From Thenard's Chemistry, Vol.</cite> ii. <em>p.</em> 525.)</p>

<p>This match is prepared by mingling two parts of the oxymuriate
of potash and one of sulphur, which by means of a
little gum is attached to a common sulphur match. This match
on being dipped into, or rather slightly wet with, strong sulphuric
acid, (oil of vitriol) immediately catches fire.</p>

<p>The author has not added the caution that the sulphur and
salt should be pulverized separately; if rubbed together in a
mortar, they will explode with some danger to the operator,
provided the quantity be over a few grains.</p>

<p>Matches made upon this principle, have been for some time
made and sold in this country. They are sometimes put up
in little japanned cases with a small phial, from which when inverted
with the mouth open, nothing will drop, and yet the
match kindles on being thrust in quite to the bottom. The
truth is, these bottles contain a little amianthus moistened with
sulphuric acid, which thus kindles the match, but as the acid
soon weakens by attracting water from the air, it is better to
use a phial of the acid in the liquid state. A few drops answer
the purpose, and when this is weakened, it is easily renewed.</p>


<p class="p1 center">7. <cite>Cleaveland's Mineralogy.</cite></p>

<p>Our opinion of this work was fully expressed in the review
of it in our first number. In the Edinburgh Review for September,
1818, this work is again reviewed, and in a manner
which must gratify every friend to American science. It will
be necessary to cite only a single sentence. After commending
the condensed and <em>honest</em> manner in which the work is printed,
(for they say, that the same matter which here fills one volume
would in England have been spread over three,) the reviewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
adds, "We should be glad to see it reprinted exactly
upon the plan of the original; and we have no doubt that it
would be found <em>the most useful work on mineralogy in our language</em>."
More need not be&mdash;more scarcely could be said.</p>


<p class="p1 center">8. <em>A new Alkali.</em></p>

<p>A new alkali has recently been discovered in Sweden, by
M. Arfwedson. It is found in the petalite, a mineral from
Utoen, in Sweden, in a proportion not over 5 pr. ct.; also in
the triphane or spodumene, in the proportion of 8 per cent.
and in what is called crystallized lepidolite, in the proportion
of 4 per cent. In its general properties it very nearly resembles
the other alkalies. When heated in contact with platinum
it acts on it. In the galvanic circuit it was decomposed "with
bright scintillations, and the reduced metal being separated,
afterward burnt." This metal resembles sodium. The new
alkali has been called lithia. (<cite>Jour. of Science of the Roy. Inst.</cite>)</p>


<p class="p1 center">9. <em>Ignited Platinum Wire.</em></p>

<p>In our last we mentioned the lamp without flame, the ignition
of platinum wire being sustained by means of the vapour
of alcohol.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy has discovered that the vapour of camphor
answers the same purpose: "If a piece of camphor, or a few
small fragments in a heap, be placed in any convenient situation,
as on a shilling, the bottom of a glass, &amp;c. and a piece of platinum
wire, either coiled or pressed up together, be heated
and laid upon it, the platinum will glow as long as any camphor
remains, and will frequently light it up into a flame."</p>

<p class="p1 center">10. <em>Red Rain.</em></p>

<p>A red rain fell in Naples, (March 14, 1818,) the common
people were much alarmed, and called it <em>blood</em> or <em>fire</em>.</p>

<p>An earthy powder was collected, which when dry was yellow,
unctuous, and of an earthy taste; its specific gravity

<p class="p1 center">21. <em>Discovery of American Tungsten and Tellurium.</em></p>

<p>Neither of these metals, so far as we are informed, has been
announced as existing in either of the Americas. It is well
known to mineralogists, that tungsten is very rare, and that tellurium
is found only in Transylvania.</p>

<p>We have now the pleasure to state that both these metals
exist in the Bismuth mine, in the town of Huntington, parish
of New Stratford, in Connecticut, 20 miles west of New-Haven.</p>

<p>During the examination of some ores, brought to us by Mr.
Ephraim Lane, the proprietor of this mine, we obtained the
tungsten in the state of yellow oxid, and the tellurium in the
metallic state.</p>

<p>The tungsten is stated to be abundant in the mine; it is the
ferruginous species, known to mineralogists by the name of
wolfram.</p>

<p>We cannot yet say whether the tellurium is abundant, having
obtained it from only two pieces; from these we extracted
also tungsten, so that it may possibly constitute a new mineral
species. Further particulars will be given in our next Number.</p>


<p class="p1 center">22. <em>Mr. Sheldon's Application of Chesnut Wood to the Arts
of Tanning and Dying.</em></p>

<p class="p1 pfs70">REMARKS.</p>

<p>A considerable time since, we were confidentially made
acquainted with the discovery detailed in the following letter.
We have repeated the most important of Mr. Sheldon's experiments,
both in relation to tanning and dying, and are well satisfied
that the discoverer has not overrated, or erroneously
estimated, the value of his own results. We are persuaded
that the highly <em>useful</em> arts alluded to, will derive important aid
from the use of a material so abundant and cheap as chesnut
wood.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>To Professor Silliman.</em></p>

<p class="right"><em>Springfield, Mass. Feb. 27, 1819.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I send you a more particular account of the newly discovered
properties of the chesnut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>This tree, <i>Fagus Castanea</i>, Linn. is very abundant in New-England
and the middle states; and occurs in the mountainous
districts, as far southward as South-Carolina, or perhaps even
Georgia. It is one of the stateliest trees of the forest; scarcely
less distinguished by the beauty of its foliage, than by the durability
of its wood.</p>

<p>By repeated analyses, conducted with the minutest attention
to every circumstance which could ensure accuracy, it appears,
incredible as it may seem, that the chesnut <em>wood</em> contains twice
as much tannin as ross'd<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> <em>oak bark</em>, and six-sevenths as much
colouring matter (which gives a black with iron,) as logwood.
I am aware that nothing could be farther from the common apprehension
than such results; but the uniform success of a
great variety of experiments in tanning and dying, in addition
to the other kind of evidence, should satisfy the most incredulous.</p>

<p>The leather tanned with it, has, in every instance, been superior
to that tanned in a comparative experiment, with oak
bark; being firmer, less porous, and at the same time more
pliable. The reason for this difference, will probably be
found in the <em>high state of oxygenizement</em> of the bark, particularly
of the epidermis, by which it is rendered to a certain
degree acrid and corrosive. Dr. Bancroft was perhaps the
first who noticed the oxygenizement of barks. He attributes
the dark brown colour of the epidermis of <em>his</em> quercitron, to
this cause; and as a confirmation of the idea, I have observed
that ink made of the epidermis of another kind of bark, though
at first not to be distinguished by the colour from that made
of the cellular and cortical parts, is incomparably less permanent.</p>

<p>As a material for making ink, the wood of the chesnut is
probably unrivalled. Combined with iron in any proportion,
it gives, as it is dilute or concentrated, a pure blue or blue-black;
while galls, sumach, &amp;c. &amp;c. unless combined with a
greater proportion than is consistent with the highest degree
of permanency, afford a <em>black</em> more or less inclining to a reddish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
brown. The lake of the chesnut is indeed a blue, and not
to be distinguished by the eye from indigo; but when diffused
on paper, this same substance becomes an intense shining black.
In dying, little difference is observable between the chesnut
and galls, and sumach, except that the former has a rather
greater affinity for wool, &amp;c. than the latter, and of course requires
less boiling. Its permanency has been completely
tested by long exposure to the sun and the weather; but no
doubt can exist on this head, if the position of Berthollet be
true, that permanent blacks are formed only by the combination
of iron and tannin.</p>

<p>To prepare the chesnut wood for the purposes of tanning, a
mode has been devised for reducing it to a suitable degree of
fineness. This method consists in the application of knives,
either in the direction of, or transversely to the grain, by a rotatory
motion. This mode obviously involves the greatest possible
economy of moving power. Messrs. B. and M. Stebbins, of
West-Springfield, who are making arrangements for going largely
into the exportation of the article, have in construction a
machine upon this plan.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the inspissated aqueous extract of the
chesnut, bears a near resemblance in many particulars, to catechu.
Professor Dewey, of William's College, who at my request,
has gone through an extensive and elaborate course of
experiments, informed me that he obtained a quarter more of
the gelatinous precipitate from the former, than from the latter.
By the taste, the two substances are not to be distinguished,
except that the former is more pungent. It leaves upon the
tongue, the same permanent and refreshing sweetness, for
which the other is so much prized in the east; where it is used
as an article of luxury, with betel nut. Might not the extract
be advantageously substituted for catechu, in the celebrated
life preserving composition of Dr. Pearson; the object being
to concentrate the greatest possible quantity of nutritious and
tonic substances in the smallest weight.</p>

<p>The colouring properties of the two substances, are entirely
different. After the discovery, twelve or fifteen years since, of
the composition of the <i>terra japonica</i>, attempts were made in
England to introduce it into the materia tingentia, as a substi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>tute
for galls; but unfortunately, like the extract of quercitron,
it affords with iron nothing but a meagre olive; and Dr. Bancroft
states, that in a great number of trials, he was unable, by
the greatest accumulation, to produce any thing like a black,
even upon wool, much less upon cotton and silk.</p>

<p>A singular fact, which I observed in the course of my experiments,
is worthy of notice. I had prepared for a certain
purpose, solutions from the wood of the trunk of a tree, about
three feet, and from that of a limb about three inches in diameter.
The same quantity of wood and of the solvent was
employed in both cases. On adding to each the same quantity
of the solution of gelatine, abundant precipitates immediately
appeared, as usual, apparently much the same in quantity;
but to my astonishment, the size of the several congeries in
each, bore a near proportion to that of the sticks from which
they were obtained, not differing much from that of middling
and of very small flakes of snow. Is not this an extraordinary
fact, evincive of a complication in the arrangement of these
bodies hitherto unsuspected. May it not at some future period,
lead to a <em>nomenclature of precipitates</em>; affording, like the
crystallography of Haüy, a new and accurate mode of determining
the compositions of substances; and perhaps throwing light
upon the obscure subject of chemical, or if you please, electro-chemical
affinities. The <em>size</em> of a stick might probably be ascertained
with almost as much precision, as by actual admeasurement.
The solutions in this experiment, were formed by
maceration in cold water. When hot water was employed,
and the process was completed in two or three hours, the appearance
of the precipitate was very different, the congeries
being smaller, irregular, and not well defined.</p>

<p>I have only to add, that having taken measures to secure the
discovery, both in this country and Europe, it is my wish to
bring it into general use as speedily as possible.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr4">I am, Sir, very respectfully,</span><br />

<span class="padr2">Your obedient servant,</span><br />

WILLIAM SHELDON.</p>

<p>P. S. In a short article for some future number, I may send
you an account of the operation of the machine, and of some
other particulars.</p>

<p class="p1 center">23. <em>Additional note concerning the Tungsten and Tellurium.</em></p>

<p>We have not room to insert in the present number, a description
and a chemical examination of the ores of tungsten and
tellurium recently discovered in Connecticut; they will appear
in our next.</p>

<p>In the mean time it may be stated, that the tungsten and tellurium
are found blended in the same pieces, but whether in
mere mixture, or in chemical combination, is not yet quite determined.
Many specimens of the tungsten exist without the
tellurium, but every piece which has afforded tellurium has also
afforded tungsten, and in greater abundance. Even in well
defined crystals, both metals have been found in the same crystal,
and where the external appearance was homogeneous. In
other specimens a difference seems to be apparent, and a proper
ore of tellurium appears to be blended with a proper ore
of tungsten. This latter ore is the wolfram, composed of oxid
of tungsten, or as some choose to say, tungstic oxid combined
with iron and manganese. The crystals, however, are octahedral,
a fact which we believe is not mentioned of this species by
authors, although this form is found in the calcareous tungsten.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Bismuth mine in which these ores are found is the
property of Mr. Ephraim Lane. Letters addressed, post paid,
to him at New Stratford, town of Huntington, Connecticut,
will find him through the Post Office; and he will, for a reasonable
compensation, pack boxes more or less extensive, for
mineralogists and others. As Mr. Lane is by occupation a
farmer, and is obliged to blast a quartz gangue in order to obtain
his specimens, he cannot be expected to transmit them
gratis. His mine, which has been sunk only ten feet, affords
native bismuth, native silver, magnetical and common iron pyrites,
and copper pyrites, (the two latter crystallized) galena,
blende, tungsten, tellurium, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is expected that the shaft will soon be sunk deeper, when
probably a more abundant supply of good specimens will be
obtained.</p>

<p>N. B. The silver and galena are the least abundant.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span> will conclude this part of the narrative with a brief notice
of a few curiosities occurring in the region which has
been described.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Caves.</em></p>

<p>1. It is well known that it furnishes a great number of interesting
<em>caves</em>. They are found alike in the inclined and horizontal
strata. Some of them are several miles in extent, and
afford fine specimens of earthy and alkaline salts.</p>

<p>Wier's cave in Virginia has been described by Mr. Kain.
I have in my possession a map of its most important apartments,
including its whole length, copied from a survey made
by Mr. J. Pack in Oct. 1806; also the notes of another survey
made in May 1816, by the Rev. Conrad Speece of Augusta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
county, and Mr. Robert Grattan; which, with an explanation,
and particular description, I hope to be able to transmit to you
at a future time.</p>

<p>From these surveys, it appears that the whole extent of the
cave, hitherto discovered, does not exceed eight hundred yards.
This was the length stated to me by the guide, when I visited
it in August, 1817. I cannot but think there is some mistake
in Mr. Kain's remark, that "it is a mile and a half in extent."
I spent four hours in examining every accessible part, and by
permission of Mr. Henry Bingham, the owner, made a large
collection of specimens, which were transmitted for the Cabinet
of Yale College.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>The Natural Bridge.</em></p>

<p>2. My object m naming this celebrated curiosity, is not to
give a new description of it, but merely to furnish a correct
account of its dimensions. I visited it in company with the
Rev. Mr. Huson, who had previously found its height by a
cord, to be two hundred and ten feet. We now found it by
the quadrant, to be two hundred and eleven feet, and the arch
through the centre about forty feet.</p>

<p>Some have attempted to account for this great curiosity, by
supposing that a convulsion in nature may have rent the hill,
in which it stands, asunder; thus forming the deep and narrow
defile, over which the rocky strata were left, which constitute
its magnificent arch. If so; the sides should have corresponding
parts. At a distance from the base, no such correspondence
is perceptible. At the base, the rocks are more or less craggy
and irregular. This led me to take the courses and distances
of each side. The following was the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>
<p>The chain used contained 50 links, equal to 33 feet and ⅓.
The distance between the abutments at the north end of their
bases, is 80 feet; at the south end, 66 feet. As they ascend, the
distance is greater. These data give the following diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p337.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Although considerable resemblance appears at the base, yet
as no such correspondence is visible 40 feet above it, and the
sides for the whole remaining distance to the arch, one hundred
and thirty feet, lose their craggy appearance entirely, and
present the smooth, irregular surface of the oldest rocks. I
am led to think that the natural bridge is coeval with a very
remote period of time. Nor is there any difficulty even in supposing
it to have proceeded from the hand of the Almighty, as
it is; for great and marvellous are all his works!</p>

<p>The following anecdote will evince the effect which the sight
of the natural bridge produced on a servant, who, without having
received any definite or adequate ideas of what he was to
see, attended his master to this spot.</p>

<p>On the summit of the hill, or from the top of the Bridge,
the view is not more awful than that which is seen from the
brink of a hundred other precipices. The grand prospect is
from below. To reach it you must descend the hill by a blind
path, which winds through a thicket of trees, and terminates
at the instant when the whole bridge with its broad sides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
lofty arch, all of solid rock, appears perfectly in sight. Not
one in a thousand can forbear to make an involuntary pause:
but the servant, who had hitherto followed his master, without
meeting with any thing particularly to arrest his attention, had
no sooner arrived at this point, and caught a glance of the object
which burst upon his vision, than he fell upon his knees,
fixed in wonder and admiration.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>A River flowing from a Cave.</em></p>

<p>3. I will next mention <em>a singular cave</em>, which I do not remember
ever to have seen described. It is situated in the
Cherokee country, at Nicojack, the north-western angle in the
map of Georgia, and is known by the name of the Nicojack
cave. It is 20 miles S. W. of the Look-Out mountain, and half
a mile from the south bank of the Tennessee River. The
Rackoon mountain in which it is situated, here fronts to the
northeast. Immense layers of horizontal limestone form a
precipice of considerable height. In this precipice the cave
commences; not however with an opening of a few feet, as is
common; but with a mouth fifty feet high, and one hundred and
sixty wide. Its roof is formed by a solid and regular layer of
limestone, having no support but the sides of the cave, and as
level as the floor of a house. The entrance is partly obstructed
by piles of fallen rocks, which appear to have been dislodged
by some great convulsion. From its entrance, the cave consists
chiefly of one grand excavation through the rocks, preserving
for a great distance the same dimensions as at its mouth.</p>

<p>What is more remarkable than all, it forms for the whole
distance it has yet been explored, a walled and vaulted passage,
for a stream of cool and limpid water, which, where it leaves
the cave, is six feet deep and sixty feet wide. A few years
since, Col. James Ore of Tennessee, commencing early in the
morning, followed the course of this creek in a canoe, for three
miles. He then came to a fall of water, and was obliged to
return, without making any further discovery. Whether he
penetrated three miles up the cave or not, it is a fact he did
not return till the evening, having been busily engaged in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
subterranean voyage for twelve hours. He stated that the
course of the cave after proceeding some way to the southwest
became south; and southeast by south, the remaining distance.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Natural Nitre.</em></p>

<p>The sides of the principal excavation present a few apartments
which are interesting, principally because they furnish
large quantities of the earth from which the nitrate of potash
is obtained. This is a circumstance very common to the caves
of the western country. In that at Nicojack, it abounds, and
is found covering the surfaces of fallen rocks, but in more
abundance beneath them. There are two kinds, one is called
the "clay dirt," the other the "black dirt;" the last is much
more strongly impregnated than the first. For several years
there has been a considerable manufacture of saltpetre from
this earth. The process is by lixiviation and crystallization,
and is very simple. The earth is thrown into a hopper, and
the fluid obtained, passed through another of ashes, the alkali
of which decomposes the earthy nitrate, and uniting with its
acid, which contains chiefly nitrate of lime, turns it into nitrate
of potash. The precipitated lime gives the mass a whitish colour,
and the consistence of curdled milk. By allowing it to
stand in a large trough, the precipitate, which is principally
lime, subsides, and the superincumbent fluid, now an alkaline,
instead of an earthy nitrate, is carefully removed and boiled for
some time in iron kettles, till it is ready to crystallize. It is
then removed again to a large trough, in which it shoots into
crystals. It is now called "rough shot-petre." In this state
it is sent to market, and sells usually for sixteen dollars per
hundred weight. Sometimes it is dissolved in water, reboiled,
and recrystallized, when it is called refined, and sells for twenty
dollars per hundred. One bushel of the clay dirt yields from
3 to 5lbs. and the black dirt from 7 to 10lbs. of the rough shot-petre.
The same dirt, if returned to the cave, and scattered
on the rocks, or mingled with the new earth, becomes impregnated
with the nitrate again, and in a few months may be thrown
into the hopper, and be subjected to a new process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>The causes which have produced the nitric salts of these
caves, may not yet have been fully developed. But it is highly
probable, they are to be ascribed to the decomposition of animal
substances.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to suppose, that in an uncultivated country
they would become the abodes of wild animals, and even of
savage men. That they have been used by the natives as burial
places, is certain. In one which I entered, I counted a
hundred human skulls, in the space of twenty feet square.
All the lesser and more corruptible parts of each skeleton had
mouldered to dust, and the whole lay in the greatest confusion.
I have heard of many such caves, and to this day some of the
Indians are known to deposit their dead in them. From the decomposition
of such substances, it is well known the acid of the
nitric salts arises, and it would of course unite with the lime
every where present, and form nitrate of lime.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Mounds.</em></p>

<p>4. I have but one more article of curiosity to mention under
this division. It is one of those artificial <em>mounds</em> which occur
so frequently in the western country. I have seen many of
them, and read of more. But never of one of such dimensions
as that which I am now to describe.</p>

<p>It is situated in the interior of the Cherokee nation, on the
north side of the Etowee, vulgarly called Hightower River,
one of the branches of the Koosee. It stands upon a strip of
alluvial land, called <em>River Bottom</em>. I visited it in company with
eight Indian chiefs. The first object which excited attention
was an excavation about twenty feet wide, and in some parts
ten feet deep. Its course is nearly that of a semicircle; the
extremities extending towards the river, which forms a small
elbow. I had not time to examine it minutely. An Indian
said it extended each way to the river, and had several unexcavated
parts, which served for passages to the area which it
encloses. To my surprise, I found no embankment on either
side of it. But I did not long doubt to what place the earth
had been removed; for I had scarcely proceeded two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
yards, when, through the thick forest trees, a stupendous pile
met the eye, whose dimensions were in full proportion to the
intrenchment. I had at the time no means of taking an accurate
admeasurement. To supply my deficiency, I cut a long
vine, which was preserved until I had an opportunity of ascertaining
its exact length. In this manner I found the distance
from the margin of the summit to the base, to be one hundred
and eleven feet. And judging from the degree of its declivity,
the <em>perpendicular height</em> cannot be less than seventy-five feet.
The circumference of the base, including the feet of three
parapets, measured one thousand one hundred and fourteen
feet. One of these parapets extends from the base to the summit,
and can be ascended, though with difficulty, on horseback.
The other two, after rising thirty or forty feet, terminate in a
kind of triangular platform. Its top is level, and at the time I
visited it, was so completely covered with weeds, bushes, and
trees of most luxuriant growth, that I could not examine it as
well as I wished. Its diameter, I judged, must be one hundred
and fifty feet. On its sides and summit, are many large trees
of the same description, and of equal dimensions with those
around it. One beach-tree, near the top, measured ten feet
nine inches in circumference. The earth on one side of the
tree, was three and a half feet lower than on the opposite side.
This fact will give a good idea of the degree of the mound's
declivity. An oak, which was lying down on one of the parapets,
measured at the distance of six feet from the butt, without
the bark, twelve feet four inches in circumference. At a
short distance to the southeast is another mound, in ascending
which I took thirty steps. Its top is encircled by a breastwork
three feet high, intersected through the middle with
another elevation of a similar kind. A little farther is another
mound, which I had not time to examine.</p>

<p>On these great works of art, the Indians gazed with as much
curiosity as any white man. I inquired of the oldest chief, if
the natives had any tradition respecting them; to which he
answered in the negative. I then requested each to say what
he supposed was their origin. Neither could tell: though all
agreed in saying; "they were never put up by our people."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
It seems probable they were erected by another race, who
once inhabited the country. That such a race existed, is now
generally admitted. Who they were, and what were the
causes of their degeneracy, or of their extermination, no circumstances
have yet explained. But this is no reason why we
should not, as in a hundred other instances, infer the existence
of the cause from its effects, without any previous knowledge
of its history.</p>

<p>In regard to the objects which these mounds were designed
to answer, it is obvious they were not always the same. Some
were intended as receptacles for the dead. These are small,
and are distinguished by containing human bones. Some may
have been designed as sites for public buildings, whether of a
civil or religious kind; and others no doubt were constructed
for the purposes of war. Of this last description, is the Etowee
mound. In proof of its suitableness for such a purpose, I
need only mention that the Cherokees in their late war with
the Creeks, secured its summit by pickets, and occupied it as
a place of protection for hundreds of their women and children.
Gladly would I have spent a day in examining it more
minutely; but my companions, unable to appreciate my motives,
grew impatient, and I was obliged to withdraw, and leave a
more perfect observation and description to some one else.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Alluvial Formation.</em></p>

<p>I will now call your attention to the last geological division
which came under my observation. It is the alluvial tract,
extending from the Dividing Ridge already mentioned, to the
Gulf of Mexico. This Ridge is the last range of high land
which I crossed on the journey to New Orleans, and lies about
six hundred miles north of the Gulf of Mexico. Its course at
the place I crossed it, is a little south of west. It divides the
waters of the Tennessee from those which proceed directly
to the gulf. Travellers always observe it. They often mentioned
it to me as the southern boundary of the <em>stony country</em>.
After crossing it, you see no more limestone; and, which excites
more joy in the traveller, no more of the silicious gravel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
with which it is associated, and which is so troublesome to the
feet of horses. The soil consists of a soft clay, or light sand,
on which you seldom meet with a stone of any kind. The
surface of the earth is undulating and hilly, but not mountainous.
The water-courses do not move rapidly and tumultuously,
as in the limestone country; but form in the soft earth,
deep trenches, through which they glide smoothly and silently
along. The smallest rivulet often has a trench ten feet deep;
and the earth over which it passes, is continually yielding to
its gentle attrition.</p>

<p>The only minerals which I observed, are sandstone, common
and ferruginous; silicious pebbles in beds of creeks, and occasionally
on the uplands; earthy ores of iron, particularly
red oxides, and petrifactions of shells, wood, &amp;c. In addition
to these, it may here be mentioned that galena has been found
in small quantities at Gibson's Port, and at Ellis's Cliffs, in the
State of Mississippi: a crystal of amethyst, in the same state,
by Mr. Blannerhassett; and a great variety of useful ochres,
in many places on the banks of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>In the geological map attached to Professor Cleaveland's Mineralogy,
the alluvial country bordering on the Gulf of Mexico,
is represented as terminating at Natchez. But why its termination
is placed here, I am unable to understand. The country
above and below Natchez, so far as it has come under my observation,
presents no difference of appearance in its geology,
or mineralogy. I am aware that at Natchez, when the water
of the Mississippi is lowest, a soft rock is seen, from which
lime has been obtained. But this rock is two hundred feet
below the surface of the adjoining country; and admitting that
it is a limestone rock, there is no difficulty in supposing it may
constitute the basis of the alluvial deposit which rests upon it.
That the incumbent earth is <em>alluvial</em>, can be doubted, I think,
by no one who has had an opportunity of examining it. By
means of a road, which has been cut obliquely down the side
of the bluff, distinct layers of clay, sand, and pebbles, have
been exposed for the whole distance from the summit to the
base. The same character is observed at a distance from the
river, where the earth has been excavated by washing, or dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>ging.
In the vicinity of the town, there is a curious exhibition
of the fact. A stream of water has worn away the earth to
the depth of fifteen or twenty feet, and is continually lengthening
the chasm, in the direction opposite to its own course.
Thus, as the water flows from the town, the chasm approaches
it. In examining the cause of this fact, I perceived it was
owing chiefly to the difference of cohesion in the alluvial deposits,
of which the earth is formed. That at the surface,
being a thick loam, wears away with more difficulty than the
deposit below it, which consists of a loose sand. The consequence
is, that the water, which has once obtained a perpendicular
passage of a few inches through the first, washes away
the second with such rapidity, that it is constantly undermining
it. This occasions a perpetual caving in of the surface, in a
direction opposite to the course of the stream. The same fact
is observed in many parts of the country for a great distance
above Natchez. If there be wanting any other fact to prove
that the earth on which the town of Natchez stands, is alluvial,
it is found in the effect which the Mississippi has upon the base
of the Natchez bluff. In consequence of a bend in the river,
the whole force of its current is thrown against this base. If
it consisted of solid rock, the river would probably have no
effect upon it; but of such loose and friable materials is it composed,
that the river is continually undermining it, and producing
effects not less to be dreaded than those of an earthquake.
Several years ago, a great number of acres sunk fifty feet or
more below the general surface of the hill; and in 1805, there
was another caving of that part directly over the small village
at the landing. Several houses were buried in consequence
of it, and strong fears are entertained by the inhabitants, that
the same cause will yet submerge in the Mississippi, the whole
of the present landing-place.</p>

<p>These facts, I think you will say, furnish satisfactory evidence
of the alluvial character of the country at Natchez.
The same character belongs to the whole extent south of the
Dividing Ridge. This may be safely inferred from the general
features of the country. But I have two facts, of a geological
kind, to mention, both of which go to confirm the opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>1. A well was dug in the Choctaw nation, at the agency of
the United States, in the year 1812 or 1813, under the direction
of Silas Dinsmore, Esq. the agent. The excavation was
continued to the depth of one hundred and seventy-two feet.
No water was found. At no great distance from the surface,
marine exuviæ were found in abundance. The shells were
small, and imbedded in a soft clay, similar to marine earth.
This formation continued till the excavation ceased. Dispersed
through it, were found lumps of selenite, or foliated gypsum,
some of which were half as large as a man's fist. Specimens
of the earth, the exuviæ, and the selenite, have been
transmitted for your examination. This excavation was made
one hundred and twenty miles north northeast of Natchez.
The Pearl River is four miles to the east of the place, and is
the only considerable stream in this part of the country.</p>

<p>2. In the Chickasaw nation, one hundred and seventy miles
north of the Choctaw agency, commence beds of oyster-shells,
which continue to be seen at intervals for twelve miles. Four
miles from the first bed, you come to what is called "Chickasaw
Old Town," where they are observed in great abundance.
They are imbedded in low ridges of a white marl. They appear
to be of two kinds. Specimens of each, and also of the
marl, you have received. "Chickasaw Old Town," is a name
now appropriated to a prairie, on a part of which there formerly
stood a small village of Chickasaws. The prairie is
twenty miles long, and four wide. The shells occur in three
places as you cross it, and again, on two contiguous hills to the
east of it, at the distance of four miles. They do not cover
the surface merely. They form a constituent part of the hills
or plains in which they are found. Wherever the earth has
been washed so as to produce deep gutters, they are seen in
greatest abundance. Nor are they petrifactions, such as are
found in rocks. They have the same appearance as common
oyster-shells, they lie loose in the earth, and thus indicate a
comparatively recent origin. They occur <em>three hundred miles</em>
northeast of Natchez, and but <em>sixty</em> miles south of the Dividing
Ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>If the country north of Natchez is alluvial, no one will doubt
it is so from this place to the Gulf of Mexico. At Baton
Rouge, one hundred and forty miles north of New Orleans, you
meet the first elevated land in ascending from the gulf. The
banks of the Mississippi are higher than the interior, and would
be annually overflowed by the river, but for a narrow embankment
of earth about six feet high, called the Levee. By
means of this, a narrow strip of land, from half a mile to a
mile in width, is redeemed, and cultivated with cotton and the
sugar cane, to the great advantage of the planter. Generally,
within one mile from the river, there is an impenetrable
morass. The country has every where the appearance of an
origin comparatively recent. Not a rock on which you can
stand, and no mountain to gladden the eye; you seem to have
left the older parts of creation to witness the encroachments
which the earth is continually making upon the empire of the
sea; and on arriving at the mouth of the Mississippi, you find
the grand instruments of nature in active operation, producing
with slow, but certain gradations, the same results.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>A destructive Insect.</em></p>

<p>But I will not enlarge on a fact already familiar. I will ask
your further indulgence only, while I communicate an authentic
and curious fact for the information of the zoologist.</p>

<p>In the Choctaw country, one hundred and thirty miles
northeast of Natchez, a part of the public road is rendered
famous on account of the periodical return of a poisonous and
destructive fly. Contrary to the custom of other insects, it
always <em>appears</em> when the <em>cold weather</em> commences in December,
and as invariably <em>disappears</em> on the approach of <em>warm
weather</em>, which is about the first of April. It is said to have
been remarked first in the winter of 1807, <em>during a snowstorm</em>;
when its effects upon cattle and horses were observed
to be similar to those of the gnat and musqueto, in summer,
except that they were more severe. It continued to return
at the same season of the year, without producing extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
mischief, until the winter of 1816, when it began to be generally
fatal to the horses of travellers. So far as I recollect, it
was stated, that from thirty to forty travelling horses were
destroyed during this winter. The consequences were alarming.
In the wilderness, where a man's horse is his chief
dependence, the traveller was surprised and distressed to see
the beast sicken and die in convulsions, sometimes within
three hours after encountering this little insect. Or if the
animal were fortunate enough to live, a sickness followed,
commonly attended with the sudden and entire shedding of the
hair, which rendered the brute unfit for use. Unwilling to
believe that effects so dreadful could be produced by a cause
apparently trifling, travellers began to suspect that the
Indians, or others, of whom they obtained food for their
horses, had, for some base and selfish end, mingled poison
with it. The greatest precaution was observed. They refused
to stop at any house on the way, and carried, for the
distance of forty or fifty miles, their own provision; but after
all suffered the same calamities. This excited a serious inquiry
into the true cause of their distress. The fly, which
has been mentioned, was known to be a most singular insect,
and peculiarly troublesome to horses. At length it was admitted
by all, that the cause of the evils complained of could
be no other than this insect. Other precautions have since
been observed, particularly that of riding over the road infested
with it <em>in the night</em>; and now it happens that comparatively
few horses are destroyed. I am unable to describe it
from my own observation. I passed over the same road in
April last, only two weeks after it disappeared, and was obliged
to take the description from others. Its colour is a dark
brown; it has an elongated head, with a small and sharp proboscis;
and is in size between the gnat and musqueto.
When it alights upon a horse, it darts through the hair, much
like a gnat, and never quits its hold until removed by force.
When a horse stops to drink, swarms fly about the head, and
crowd into the mouth, nostrils, and ears; hence it is supposed
the poison is communicated inwardly. Whether this be true
or not, the most fatal consequences result. It is singular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
that from the time of its first appearance, it has never extended
for a greater distance than forty miles, in one direction,
and usually, it is confined to fifteen miles. In no other part
of the country has it ever been seen. From this fact, it would
seem probable that the cause of its existence is local. But
what it is, none can tell. After the warm weather commences,
it disappears as effectually from human observation, as if it
were annihilated. Towards the close of December it springs
up all at once into being again, and resumes the work of destruction.
A fact, so singular, I could not have ventured to
state, without the best evidence of its reality. All the circumstances
here related, are familiar to hundreds, and were in
almost every man's mouth, when I passed through the country.
In addition to this, they were confirmed by the account
which I received from Col. John M'Kee, a gentleman of much
intelligence and respectability, who is the present agent of
the general government for the Choctaw nation. He has
consented to obtain specimens of the insect for your examination,
when it returns again; and will, I hope, accompany the
transmission with a more perfect description than it has been
possible for me to communicate.</p>

<p>In concluding this narrative of facts, I should be glad to
take a comprehensive view of the whole. The bold features
in the geology of the United States, as they are drawn by the
Blue Ridge, the Cumberland with its associated mountains,
and the Dividing Ridge, deserve to be distinctly and strongly
impressed upon the mind. Such is the order and regularity
of their arrangement, that they can hardly fail to conduct the
attentive observer to important results. What has now been
said of them, is but an epitome of the whole. I trust the
public will soon read, in the pages of your Journal, a detail
more perfect and more interesting. And allow me to suggest,
whether, under the auspices of our learned societies, some
men of science might not be employed and supported in exploring
the country, with the prospect of greatly enlarging
the science of our country, and of enriching our Journals and
Cabinets of Natural History. Tours of discovery have often
been made for other objects, and with success. Our country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
yields to no other in the variety, or the value of its natural
productions. We owe it to ourselves and to the world, to
search them out with diligence and without delay.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>St. Louis, (Missouri Ter.) March 3, 1819.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap pad1">Sir</span>,<br />


<span class="fs200">T</span>he probable cause of the origin and continuance of <em>prairies</em>
has been the subject of much speculation among the
learned and curious. The inquiry is interesting; and many
theories have arisen; but although plausible and ingenious,
they are, in my opinion, unfounded in fact.</p>

<p>I should be glad to see the following remarks, which were
called forth more particularly by the speculations of Caleb
Atwater, Esq. (See <a href="#Page_116">No. 2. p. 116</a>. of this work) appear in
your valuable Journal of Science; and they are, for that purpose,
at your service.</p>

<p class="right padr4">With high respect, I am, Sir, your's,</p>
<p class="right">R. W. WELLS.</p>

<p class="pad1"><em>Benjamin Silliman, Esq.</em></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>Mr. Atwater, after describing the prairies and barrens, says,
that according to the common opinion, they "were occasioned
entirely by the burning of the woods," but, "erroneous
information first propagated such an opinion, and blind
credulity has extended it down to us." Mr. A. goes on to
affirm that, "wherever prairies and barrens are found,
there, for a long space of time, water once stood, but was
gradually drained off." The writer of this having often visited
and observed with attention the nature and appearance of the
prairies on the Alleghany mountains, in the states of Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois, and having long been employed by the
United States as a surveyor in the prairie country of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Missouri and Missisippi, thinks he may venture to oppose
these speculations without being thought presumptuous. He
is of opinion, that the vast prairies and barrens, extending
over the greater part of the western states, and over nearly
all Louisiana, were primitively occasioned, and have been
since continued, by the <em>combustion of vegetables</em>, and that <em>water</em>
had no agency in their formation.</p>

<p>In order to prove the high prairies of the state of Ohio to
have been once covered by the waters of Lake Erie, Mr. A.
maintains, that the channel of the Niagara river has been
worn down "<em>several hundred feet</em>" by the attrition of its
waters. Mr. A. should have shown, that the banks of the
Niagara are, at this time, several hundred feet high, or, like
the Potomac, at Harper's Ferry, has broken through a mountain
"several hundred feet" high; but neither the one nor
the other is the fact; the face of the country, on either side
of the river, is comparatively low and champaign; and were it
possible for the waters of the lake to rise considerably above
their present level, they would meet with no obstruction or
impediment, for many miles on either side the river, but
would be precipitated over the cataract, into Ontario, and
down the St. Lawrence to the Atlantic. But supposing there
had been a mountain running between Lakes Erie and Ontario
of sufficient height to prevent the water of the former from
passing into the latter, it must evidently have found other
places through which to escape, and before it would rise
high enough to overflow the elevated region of Madison and
Fayette counties, in Ohio, it would have passed over into the
heads of the Alleghany. But it is impossible to imagine this,
unless we suppose the Atlantic to have been six or seven
hundred feet higher than at present, which, according to
Mr. A. would have made prairie of all the Atlantic states.</p>

<p>The fact of shells and other marine substances having been
found in a few places, by digging in the prairies, proves
nothing, or proves too much, for they are found in equal or
greater quantities all over America, in the sides and near the
summit of the Alleghany mountains; on the Andes, in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
America, and the Alps, in Europe. The resemblance which
the soil, in the low prairies, and not in the high, bears to the
<em>alluvial</em>, can justly be attributed, it is presumed, to the leaves
and other vegetables and light materials of which they are
composed, having been washed by heavy rains, for ages past,
from the higher to the lower places. This will also account
for the circumstance of trees growing upon the summits of the
hills of steep ascent: being thin and poor, the grass neither
grows sufficiently long or thick to kill the timber when fired.
They <em>could not</em> have been islands in this fairy lake; because
their summits are frequently much <em>lower</em> than high prairie
flats a few miles distant. These are facts which will be recollected
by those who have ever travelled through a prairie
country of any extent.</p>

<p>But suppose it to have been proved, that the waters of Lake
Erie once overspread the state of Ohio, from its present shore
to Chillicothe, (a supposition which I trust has however been
shown to be visionary) does it follow that the prairies were
occasioned by such overflowing? If the water, by covering
the country, prevented the timber from growing, should we
not naturally look for the largest timber on the higher grounds
which would be first forsaken by the waters, and for small
timber on the low grounds, where the water remained longest?
If this be true, (and it is unquestionable) we should then look
for prairies on the low grounds bordering on Lakes Erie,
Huron, and Michigan; and the thickly timbered country
would be on the high land, near the sources of the rivers.
But the contrary is absolutely the fact: we find heavy timbered
land, and no <em>prairies</em>, in the low countries north of
the lakes, and none south, either in Michigan territory or
elsewhere, until we arrive near the sources of the rivers. It
is true, that the water standing in ponds will prevent the
timber from growing; but the difference is readily observed
between prairies, properly so called, and those bogs.</p>

<p>But to prove farther that water had no agency in bringing
the prairies into existence, we may mention those on and
near the summit of the Alleghany mountains, (principally in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Alleghany County.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>) Many of those prairies are ten or
twelve miles in length, and three or four in width. Will it
be pretended that the sides of those mountains were also
lakes? Farther&mdash;the most extensive prairies known, are the
very high plains immediately west of the Rocky Mountains,
and east of the mountains near the sources of the Arkansaw
and Missouri rivers, extending even on the spurs of those
mountains; a country the highest perhaps in North America,
with a great and continued descent to the Pacific on the one
side, and to the Gulf of Mexico on the other.</p>

<p>The barrens, also, found in Kentucky, are another evidence
that water had no agency in their formation&mdash;they are situate,
it is believed, in the elevated parts of the country exclusively.</p>

<p>The writer of this, deeming it unnecessary to say more, or
to produce more facts, (although much more may be said, and
many more facts produced) to prove that prairies were not
lakes, will now endeavour to prove that they were occasioned
by the <em>combustion of vegetables</em>.</p>

<p>Prairies are found in those countries only that are congenial
to the growth of grass, and only where the soil is sufficiently
rich to produce it luxuriantly&mdash;they are found commonly on
high plains, sufficiently drained to prevent water from remaining
on them the whole year; for it is by no means
necessary that they should be always dry; on the contrary,
if they are sufficiently level to prevent the rains from running
off immediately, the grass will grow thicker and higher&mdash;but
they must be sufficiently dry to burn, at least once in two or
three years, during the long, dry season, called <em>Indian summer</em>.
It has been universally remarked, that these seasons
are much longer as we proceed westerly&mdash;commencing usually
in October, and continuing a month and a half or two months,
during which the vegetation is killed by the frosts, and dried
by the sun; the wet prairies are also dried, and before the
season has expired, the grass is perfectly combustible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>
<p>The Indians, it is presumed, (and the writer, from a residence
in their country and with them, is well acquainted with
their customs) burn the woods, not <em>ordinarily</em> for the purpose
of taking or catching game, as suggested by Mr. A. but for
many other advantages attending that practice. If the woods
be not burned as usual, the hunter finds it impossible to kill
the game, which, alarmed at the great noise made in walking
through the dry grass and leaves, flee in all directions at his
approach. Also the Indians travel much during the winter,
from one village to another, and to and from the various hunting
grounds, which becomes extremely painful and laborious,
from the quantity of briers, vines, grass, &amp;c. To remedy
these and many other inconveniences, even the woods were
originally burned so as to cause prairies, and for the same
and like reasons they continue to be burned towards the
close of the Indian summer.</p>

<p>Woodland is not commonly changed to prairie by one burning,
but by several successive conflagrations; the first will kill
the undergrowth, which causing a greater opening, and admitting
the sun and air more freely, increases the quantity of
grass the ensuing season: the conflagration consequently increases,
and is now sufficiently powerful to destroy the smaller
timber; and on the third year you behold an open prairie.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, all the country, of a nature to become prairie, is
already in that state; yet the writer of this has seen, in the
country between the Missouri and Mississippi, after unusual
dry seasons, more than one hundred acres of woodland together
converted into prairie. And again, where the grass
has been prevented from burning by accidental causes, or the
prairie has been depastured by large herds of domestic cattle,
it will assume, in a few years, the appearance of a young
forest. Numerous proofs of this fact can be adduced, but a
few shall suffice. The vicinity of St. Louis and St. Charles
affords instances. Both these beautiful places are situated on
what are termed first and second bottoms, or flats&mdash;the former
on the Missisippi, the latter on the Missouri; the second or
upper bottoms, in both, are high plains, that commence within
a few hundred yards of the rivers, and extend back many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
miles; all the old French inhabitants will tell you, that the
prairies formerly came immediately up to those places. Now
the surrounding country for several miles is covered with a
growth of trees of four or five inches diameter, near the
towns where the burning first ceased, and gradually diminishing
in size as you recede, until you at length gain the open prairies.
So the barrens in Kentucky; many of the first settlers of that
state distinctly recollect when many of those barrens were
clear prairies, now partially covered with small trees. It is
deemed unnecessary to offer more proofs, or additional arguments,
in support of the opinion that the prairies were occasioned
by <em>fire</em>, and not by <em>water</em>. Indeed one glance at the
maps of those extensive prairie countries, surveyed by order
of government, where the prairies and woodland are distinguished
and correctly delineated, should carry conviction.
The timber will be there observed to skirt the rivers; in the
country near their sources a few solitary trees are seen, close
on the banks, secure from the fires, and increasing in numbers
as the rivers increase in size, and the low grounds become
more extensive.</p>

<p>The view given of the prairies by Mr. A. is correct; but
was certainly painted in the <em>winter</em> season&mdash;they are, at that
season, bleak and uncomfortable both to the feelings and
sight; but a full return is made to both when the spring
opens. The prairies (particularly to the west) are then
covered with the richest verdure, interspersed with an
immense variety of wild flowers, that send forth the most
grateful odours. Ascend one of the small hills, and you have
a prospect as delightful as it is possible for the imagination to
conceive. Far as the eye can carry you, a delightful country
extends, through which numerous streams wind their serpentine
courses, with groves and clumps of trees at intervals upon
their banks. On one hand, at an immense distance, the small
hills and groves are seen rising above the blue horizon; on
the other, the view is pleasantly terminated by the wood on
the low grounds skirting the river to which the smaller streams
are tributary&mdash;while herds of buffalo, elk, deer, and other
animals, are frequently seen slowly travelling to and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
watering-places, or grazing on the plains. The inhabited parts
of the country present a prospect still more pleasing; around
the margin of those extensive rich prairies, numerous habitations
are seen, withdrawn a short distance in the wood, from
the winter's cold and summer's heat&mdash;their finely cultivated
fields lie in the prairies, which yield at once to the plough,
without the previous Herculean labour of demolishing the
forest. The area between the farms is a common of pasture to
the numerous herds during the spring, summer, and autumn,
and a small part mowed affords hay for the winter. The
farmer who takes up his habitation in the neighbourhood of
the prairies, has <em>many</em> of the advantages of an <em>old</em> inhabited
country, and <em>all</em> the advantages of the <em>new</em>.</p>

<p>Williams' College is situated in a valley, having on the west
the hills of the <em>Taconick</em><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> range; on the east, <em>Saddle Mountain</em>,
which separates it for the most part from Adams; and on the
north, and northeast, two hills which belong to the southwestern
part of the range of the <em>Green Mountains</em>. <em>Hoosack River</em>,
rising several miles at the southeast, and passing through the
northeastern part of Williamstown, winds its course northwest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
to the Hudson. It is an inconsiderable stream, about six rods
in width, and its current is rapid. From the south, runs <em>Green
River</em>, a smaller stream, and enters the Hoosack one mile northeast
of the college. The <em>green</em> colour of this stream, appears to
be caused by a <em>magnesian</em> clay, which is washed from its banks
at the south part of the town. At the west is <em>Westbrook</em>, rising
in Williamstown, and entering the Hoosack one mile and a
half northwest of the college. The <em>soil</em> in this whole tract is
generally <em>clayey</em>, rather light for such a soil, and very rich. A
gravelly soil appears in a few places, especially at the northern
part. The <em>interval</em> on the Hoosack extends only a small distance
from its banks, rarely exceeding, and often much less,
than half a mile, and presents the common appearances of
<em>alluvial</em> land. Rising from ten to twenty feet above this interval,
the soil is in various places filled with rolled stones of
quartz and limestone, as if the Hoosack had once been much
above the banks which confine it at present. It is not improbable
that its waters were formerly intercepted by the hills in
Pownal, five miles at the northwest, forming a small lake in
this valley.</p>

<p>The hills of the <em>Taconick</em> range, (A<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>) on which passes
the line between Massachusetts and New-York, have generally
an elevation from twelve hundred to fourteen hundred
feet; <em>Pownal Mountain</em> (B) on the north, about fourteen
hundred; and <em>Oak hill</em> (D) on the northeast, twelve hundred
feet above the east college (C.) <em>Saddle Mountain</em> (EF) is an
insulated mass, separated from the Taconick range by the valley
of Williamstown, and from Hoosack Mountain, by the valley
in Adams. It lies about south southwest, and is nearly
eight miles in length, and two in breadth. It is composed of
two ranges, the eastern and highest (FG) being in Adams. The
mountain has its name from two of its peaks, which present
at a distance the appearance of the two elevations of a <em>saddle</em>.
The west range (E) is divided into <em>two parts</em> quite to its base,
which with the slope of the east range encloses, on three sides,
an irregular hollow, called the <em>Hopper</em>.(H) The northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
part (E) of the west range is nearly two miles in length, and
rises to the height of eighteen hundred feet; the southern (I)
rises abruptly into a peak of the elevation of seventeen hundred
feet. The height of the valley between the two ranges is about
fourteen hundred feet. You enter the <em>Hopper</em> from the west,
passing along a branch of Green River, and a romantic, wild,
and sublime prospect opens before you. Nearly east of the
entrance into the Hopper, lies the highest point of the Saddle,
familiarly called <em>Gray Lock</em>, (F) being about twenty-eight hundred
feet above the college, and probably four thousand feet
above the <em>tide-water</em> of the Hudson at Troy. This is the highest
land in Massachusetts. About two miles north northeast,
is the northern peak (G) elevated twenty-three hundred feet.
The valley in Adams is bounded on the east by Hoosack
mountain, (K) elevated from fourteen hundred to eighteen hundred
feet, and extending several miles west of south: it forms
a part of the range which commences at <em>West Rock</em> in Connecticut.</p>

<p>The country included in this sketch is principally <em>primitive</em>;
lying on the west of the summit of the primitive range, which
passes southerly into Connecticut. The rocks and minerals
will be mentioned in the following order.</p>

<p>1. <em>Granite.</em> A few pieces have been found at the foot of
Oak hill, one mile northeast of the college. It consists principally
of feldspar. Four miles east, are large masses of granite
on both sides of the Hoosack, and on ascending Hoosack
mountain they become more numerous. The principal part of
this is quartz, often of a purple colour; the mica black, and
the rocks exceedingly hard. I have never noticed any minerals
imbedded in it. The vortex of Pownal mountain is also
granitic.</p>

<p>2. <em>Gneiss</em> and <em>Mica Slate</em>. I connect these two, because
they are not often distinct, and appear to pass into each other.
They are found in large strata on Hoosack Mountain, on a hill
(L) connected with Saddle Mountain, and on the east side of Saddle
Mountain. The highest and the west ridge of Saddle Mountain
are mica slate. The <em>Hopper</em> shows the inclination of the
strata quite to the base of the mountain. The inclination is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the east and northeast, from ten to forty degrees. On the
southwest mountain of <em>Saddle</em>, the strata are bare to the summit
for a considerable distance, and are very fine grained mica
slate, having somewhat the appearance of a <em>soapstone slate</em>.
By this name they are called in Mr. Eaton's Index to Geology.
Some of the rocks appear to be <em>talcose</em>. I have been able,
however, to detect but a very minute quantity of magnesia in
any specimens I have tried, though I obtained a considerable
proportion of alumine. The higher hills of the Taconick
range are composed principally of a similar slate, lying in the
same direction, and with similar inclination; but it appears to
have passed still farther from mica slate. At the northwest
corner of the state, which is near the foot of the ridge in this
place, the rock is very similar to some of that on the southwest
mountain mentioned above. About a mile northwest of
this <em>corner</em>, the rocks are cleft in several places, and in one, to
such a depth, that the snow and ice remain here through the
year. The <em>Snow Hole</em> (M) is about thirty feet long, and nearly
as deep at the east end, ascends to the west, or towards the
summit of the ridge, and is from ten to twenty feet wide.
When I visited it in June, the snow was six feet deep on ice
of unknown depth. The rock is here passing into <em>argillaceous
slate</em>; and in many places it becomes <em>argillaceous</em> and <em>chlorite
slate</em>. For the other rock, you have, I believe, proposed the
name <em>talcose slate</em>.</p>

<p>3. <em>Quartz.</em> Though quartz is scattered through all the preceding
rock in masses of different sizes, it is found in great
quantity on the northeast part of Saddle Mountain, 300 or
400 feet above the college, and thence to the Hoosack along
the side of the hill (L.) It is granular, often white and translucent,
and often coloured with oxyd of iron. It forms <em>Stone
Hill</em>, (N) a mile southwest of the college, on the vertex of
which is argillaceous slate. This hill slopes to West Brook,
where quartz often forms perpendicular banks from 50 to 100
feet high. Here also argillaceous slate rests on the quartz, as
well as on the vertex, and on the east side of Stone Hill.
Quartz appears again on the opposite side of West Brook, but
further north, on a hill connected with the Taconick range.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
On these two hills, it lies in large strata, inclining, like the
mica slate, to the east and northeast, often divided by veins
into rhomboidal masses. On the east side of Stone Hill, it is
more granular, and may perhaps be called <em>arenaceous quartz</em>,
containing a larger proportion of iron. Near the base of Hoosack
Mountain, similar quartz is found, which extends round
the north side of the Hoosack to Oak Hill, (D) which is
wholly composed of it. It lies in rounded fragments, called
<em>hardheads</em>, through the northern part of the valley, and on
the sides of Oak Hill in huge rocks, presenting nearly perpendicular
fronts from 20 to 50 feet in height, and many rods in
length. The strata are in some places horizontal, and in
others nearly perpendicular. In one place it forms plates,
from 2 to 5 feet on a side, and from half an inch to several
inches in thickness, which are nearly perfect rhomboids, the
edges never being perpendicular to the sides. Most of the
quartz, except the white, yields a small portion of lime, and
has been called <em>calcareous quartz</em>. <em>Greasy quartz</em>, <em>rose quartz</em>,
hornstone, and <em>rock crystal</em>, are occasionally found; the last in
considerable quantity south of Stone Hill. On the stream
which issues from the <em>Hopper</em>, is arenaceous quartz of a slaty
structure, which is an excellent stone for sharpening the
<em>chisels</em> used by <em>stonecutters</em>.</p>

<p>4. <em>Granular Limestone</em> is abundant at the <em>Cave</em> or <em>Falls</em>, in
Adams, and on both sides of the Hoosack. The <em>Cave</em> or <em>Falls</em>,
(O) is a singular chasm between limestone rocks. A small
stream, which appears once to have run on the surface of the
hollow between two small elevations, has now worn a passage
many feet in depth through the limestone. The chasm is narrow,
winding in its course several rods long, and its opposite
sides were connected, till four years ago, by a natural bridge
of limestone. From the bridge to the water is 70 feet. There
is a dark cavern of several feet diameter, and some passages
into the rocks. The white marble walls, the foaming of the
water below, the piles and irregularity of the rocks, and the
thick overhanging trees, make the scene very wild and interesting.
The limestone rests on mica slate. On the west
bank of the Hoosack, and east base of the hill, (L) the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
coarse-grained and white limestone is found, resting on the
mica slate at the west of it.</p>

<p>At the north and west base of Saddle Mountain, (E) and at
a less elevation than the quartz, are extensive strata of limestone,
inclining the same way as the mica slate of the mountain.
It is less distinctly granular, and less white than the other, but
belongs to the same rock. It forms tolerably good marble.
Between the strata are crystals of carbonate of lime, rhomboidal,
and tending to the <em>lenticular</em> form. Some of these strata
appear to be composed of blended crystals of this kind. In
one place are strata of several rods in length and breadth,
which are inclined to the southwest, and thus lie against the
mica slate of the mountain. The inclination is about forty-five
degrees. Unless this limestone be connected with that on the
east of Saddle Mountain, (and no connexion has yet been traced,)
it must be considered as lying on both sides of the mica
slate, or alternating with it.</p>

<p>5. <em>Argillaceous Slate</em> rests on quartz on Stone Hill, and is also
found low down in the valley connected with limestone. It
constitutes the hill (P) connected with the Taconick range,
and also Northwest hill, (Q) whose base is compact limestone.
A few miles north, this slate is distinctly marked, and in about
12 miles, forms hills of <em>roof slate</em> in Hosack, New-York. It is
annually carried in large quantities to Albany. On the first-mentioned
hill, it contains some <em>talc</em>.</p>

<p>6. <em>Aluminous slate.</em> This is found in argillaceous slate, in
Pownal, 5 miles north, at the base of a hill east of the Hoosack.
It is used to <em>set</em> colours.</p>

<p>7. <em>Chlorite.</em> In rounded masses, generally with quartz,
scattered through the valley in Williamstown, and found at an
elevation of some hundred feet on the hills of the Taconick
range. Chlorite slate has already been mentioned as occurring
on the same range.</p>

<p>8. <em>Rubble Stone.</em> In rounded masses through the valley.</p>

<p>9. <em>Compact Limestone.</em> In several places low in the valley.
Near the college it is white and deep gray. In the veins of
the latter, <em>talc</em> is diffused in all directions. It contains silex,
often from 3 to 15 per cent., and sometimes gives fire with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
steel. In some cases it is earthy. On Green River, one and
a half mile south of the college, it lies in thin strata, which are
divided by seams into very regular rhomboidal plates of various
sizes. On some scattered fragments on this river, are
found carbonate of lime in crystals, with pieces of white feldspar.
On West Brook, this gray limestone is traversed by a
vein of quartz, containing sulphuret of iron. The strata of
this rock are almost invariably inclined to the east. A coarse
<em>soapstone</em> is found in the limestone near the college, and
a vein made up of brown argillaceous slate, soapstone, quartz,
and sulphuret of iron, passes through it. This limestone appears
to be very different from that at the base of Saddle
Mountain, and from that which yields the marble of Berkshire
county. It may still be <em>primitive</em>, but <em>primitive compact limestone</em>.</p>

<p>10. <em>Granitell</em> of Kirwan, <em>Quartz</em>, and <em>Feldspar</em>. This aggregate
forms extensive strata at the east base of Stone Hill. The
feldspar is diffused in grains through the quartz, and sometimes
crystalline, forming <em>porphyritic quartz</em>. This aggregate is often
compact and very hard, but frequently it is porous and hard,
forming good millstones. Sometimes the quartz appears in
such fragments, that the stone resembles <em>breccia</em>.</p>

<p>11. <em>Black Tourmaline.</em> In beautiful small six-sided prisms,
in scattered pieces of mica slate at the base of Stone Hill.</p>

<p>12. <em>Amianthus.</em> Only a small specimen, attached to <em>argillaceous
slate</em>.</p>

<p>13. <em>Bitter Spar.</em> On compact limestone at West Brook.
Some of the crystals are rhomboids, and some appear to be
the half of rhomboids split through their longer diagonal.</p>

<p>14. <em>Jasper.</em> The common brown or red, and black, in small
rounded masses, and also a piece of variegated or striped jasper.</p>

<p>15. <em>Galena.</em> Only a specimen in the limestone on West
Brook.</p>

<p>16. <em>Iron Ore.</em> <em>Bog ore</em> on the Hoosack, a mile northeast of
the college. <em>Yellow earth</em>, from which <em>yellow ochre</em> is obtained
in great quantity, in a hill (R) on the bank of Green River, 2
miles south of the college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>At the north end of Saddle Mountain, but low down, yellow
earth is connected with <em>reddle</em>, or a substance much resembling
it. It is less hard than the common reddle, but is composed
of the same ingredients.</p>

<p><em>Magnetic Oxyd of Iron</em>, regular octahedrons, in mica slate at
the base of Stone Hill.</p>

<p><em>Supersulphuret of Iron</em>, massive and crystallized, in argillaceous
slate, mica slate, compact limestone, and quartz.</p>

<p>17. <em>Prase.</em> Beautiful, and containing sulphuret of iron;
lately found by Mr. Eaton, a little east of the summit of Hoosack
Mountain, in Florida.</p>

<p>18. <em>Puddingstone.</em> Where Pownal Mountain reaches the
Hoosack, (T) 3 miles north of the college, are some hills of
this aggregate. It is composed of rounded masses of quartz,
chlorite, and limestone, of various sizes, connected by an argillaceous
cement.</p>

<p>19. <em>Potters' Clay.</em> Excellent for vessels of common pottery.</p>

<p>The minerals of this section, it is obvious, are not very important;
but as connected with a transverse section of the
country, they possess considerable interest. For this reason
they have been particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>In the north part of Williamstown is a <em>mineral spring</em>, familiarly
called the <em>Sand Spring</em> (S.) The water rises from several
places in a reservoir of about a rod in diameter, and from
one to three feet deep. It is very soft and warm, but contains
very little saline or earthy matter. Gas continually rises in
it. It appears much to resemble the spring at New Lebanon,
New-York, and has proved useful in the cure particularly of
some <em>cutaneous</em> diseases.</p>

<p>The <em>transverse section</em>, connected with the map, passes over
Stone Hill, and the north part of Saddle Mountain. The different
rocks are shown in the section, directly below their
places on the map, by drawing lines from the several strata
parallel to the sides of the map. This section is connected
with that given by Mr. Hitchcock, in the 2d number of this
Journal. It ought perhaps to be mentioned, that according
to Mr. Eaton's account, the granite of this section sinks under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
gneiss to the east, and rises again in Hampshire County,
"supporting the same rock of gneiss;" but where it reappears,
the granite contains "many imbedded minerals." This section
corresponds generally to the place and character of the minerals
in any section across Berkshire county. There are,
however, some peculiarities which may be mentioned at a future
day. The colouring corresponds to that on the geological
map in Cleaveland's Mineralogy.</p>

<p><em>Williams' College, Jan. 27, 1819.</em></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>P.S. I have a part of a <em>rock crystal</em>, which contains, in a hollow,
a <em>liquid</em> and a <em>little air</em>, and some <em>black</em> or <em>brown particles</em>,
which just sink in the liquid. It was found several years since
at Diamond Hill in Catskill. This hill is only a small eminence
on the bank of the creek at that place, composed of
limestone, (if I have been correctly informed,) between the
strata of which, and on the side next the creek, this and other
rock crystals were found. I believe, Sir, you have one like
the above, obtained from the same place. The crystal, which
was generously given me by Mr. Van Loon, who found it, is
only a part of two crystals connected at their bases. Partly
under one of the solid angles formed by the united pyramids,
is the hollow, about ⅝ inch long, about ⅜ filled with the air, and
about ¼ inch wide. The principal curiosity about it is the
liquid. It has never been known to <em>freeze</em>. It was exposed
yesterday morning an hour to an atmosphere 4 and 5 degrees
below zero. It became less fluid, for the bubble of air
moved with less ease and rapidity. Still the liquid was fluid.
Its colour, which is naturally white, had a slight tinge of yellow.
The Rev. Mr. Schaeffer of New-York supposes the black particles
are bitumen. Is it possible the liquid is <em>naptha</em>? This
oil is sometimes colourless, and does not congeal at zero, and
that which I distilled from the Seneca oil, does congeal at
some degrees below zero. It can hardly be <em>salt water</em>, unless
it be <em>very salt</em>, and even then, it would have congealed at the
temperature of the air yesterday. What way can be devised
to ascertain what it is?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>After seeing the notice of the crystals found at Hudson by
Mr. Schaeffer, I wrote to a member of the Lyceum of Natural
History, New-York, rather more full an account than the
above, of my crystal, &amp;c. I hope to ascertain, whether the
liquid will congeal at 10 or 20° below 0, but have some fear
lest the crystal should be injured.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he schorl of the mineralogists of the last century united a
variety of substances which subsequent observations have
separated into several species. The green schorl is now the
epidote, or the Vesuvian, or the actynolite. The violet schorl,
and the lenticular schorl, are the axinite. The black volcanic
schorl is the augite. The white Vesuvian schorl is the sommite.
The white grenatiform is the leucite. The white prismatic
is the pycnite, a species of the topaz, and another is a variety
of feldspar. Of the blue schorl, one variety is the oxyd of titanium,
another the sappare, and another the phosphate of
iron. The schorl cruciform is the granatite. The octahedral
schorl is the octahedrite, or anatase. The red schorl of Hungary,
and the purple of Madagascar, are varieties of the oxyd
of titanium. The spathique schorl is the spodumen.</p>

<p>The black schorl, and the electric schorl, only remained, and
to avoid the confusion created by the use of the term schorl,
the name of tourmaline was given to this species by that celebrated
mineralogist, the Abbé Haüy.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>
<p>The tourmaline is found of almost every colour, and this
variety of colour caused at first a number to be formed into
new species; which are now considered only as varieties of
the tourmaline: such as the rubellite, the tourmaline apyre,
and indicolite.</p>

<p>The different analyses of the tourmaline, however, affords a
greater variety of results than is known in almost any other
mineral.</p>

<p>These differences must be in some measure ascribed to a
defect in the accuracy of some of the analyses. But it appears
that iron has not been discovered in the red tourmaline. It is
not unworthy of notice, that the red tourmaline is considered
as infusible, but the others fusible.</p>

<p>The red tourmaline has been the most valued, from its
scarcity, its employment in jewelry, and the beauty of its
crystals. It has been discovered in Siberia, in Moravia, in
the East-Indies, and in Massachusetts. In Siberia it is found
in a vein of decomposed feldspar in a fine-grained granite, with
black tourmaline. In Moravia with quartz and lepidolite (or
rose-coloured mica) in gneiss. In the East-Indies, at Ava and
Ceylon, but its geological situation is not known, though it is
probably in gneiss or granite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The red or rose tourmaline of Massachusetts, is found
chiefly at Chesterfield, in a subordinate bed of granite, contained
in mica slate. The mica slate is the predominant rock
of the country. It is fine grained, and contains an abundance
of small garnets. Direction of the strata north and south,
varying a little easterly; inclination perpendicular. The
bed of granite is about three hundred feet long, and from five
to twenty feet broad. It is contained in a narrow ridge of
mica slate, which descends into, and is lost in, a valley. The
sides are precipitous; the highest part is about forty feet
high. On the east side a considerable part of the granite has
been destroyed by natural causes, leaving the granite bare.
The granite consists chiefly of granular feldspar, with grains
of white quartz, and a little light coloured mica, is moderately
fine grained, and of a grayish white colour. In addition to
tourmaline, it contains also emerald, some of the crystals of
which are from three to five inches in diameter. I succeeded
in getting one out of its matrix, which is three and a
half inches in diameter, and its summit (which is a plane
without any additional facettes) is perfect.</p>

<p>The tourmalines are contained chiefly in a false vein of
silicious feldspar and quartz, which begins in the centre of the
upper edge of the bed of granite, and passes obliquely, descending
to the northeast, about twenty feet, where it is intercepted
from sight by the mica slate. The vein is about one
and a half foot thick in the upper part, and not more than six
or eight inches where it is lost. This vein of silicious feldspar
contains also a vein of bluish white transparent quartz,
which is from three to eight inches thick, and passes through
the centre of the vein of feldspar.</p>

<p>When I first examined this rock, soon after its discovery
by Dr. Hunt, of Northampton, I determined the feldspar to
be a new variety, which has been since confirmed by Professor
Hauffman, and now ranks as a new sub-species, under
the name of silicious feldspar. (P. 41, of the Mineralogical
Table.)</p>

<p>The chief difference between this and the adularia is, that
one contains fourteen potash and the other nine soda. Between
this and the saussurite, or tenacious feldspar, the one
contains eleven of lime, and the other only a trace.</p>

<p>The silicious feldspar, which I suspect to be the basis of the
granite, crystallizes in thin rhomboidal tables. They are very
frangible, and have one clivage perpendicular to the faces of
the tables. Sometimes the tables have one lateral edge or
more truncated. In one fragment of a crystal I observed a
very obtuse acumination on the table, which appeared to be
diedral, the sides being placed on the obtuse lateral edges of
the tables. On account of the extreme frangibility of the
crystals, it is certainly extremely difficult to seize their characters.
Specific gravity only 2.333, probably owing to
interstices between the tables. The colour is white, translucid,
passing to semi-transparent; lustre sometimes dull, at
others shining. The tables are sometimes so aggregated that
their edges being exposed, offer wedge-shaped and stelliform
figures. The tourmalines are chiefly contained in this vein.
They are red, or green, rarely blue or black.</p>

<p>The green tourmalines vary from one-eighth of an inch to
one inch in diameter; they are sometimes four inches in
length, and are entirely confined to the inner vein of quartz.
They are triedral prisms, with convex faces, striated longitudinally,
and generally traversed perpendicularly to the axis,
with very small fissures filled by some silicious substance,
probably feldspar. These green crystals are opaque. The
red tourmaline is frequently enclosed in the green. In certain
parts of the vein almost every green crystal encloses a red
one, which always corresponds by its sides and angles with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
the exterior crystal. Sometimes a thin layer of talc intervenes
between the outer and inner crystal. In one specimen I
found three crystals of the red aggregated together, and enclosed
in one of the green. In another crystal I found pyrites
in the place of the red tourmaline. The largest crystal of
the red was one quarter of an inch in diameter, and four
inches long. The red tourmalines vary in intensity of colour,
and frequently (particularly in the interior) pass into violet.
They pass from translucid to semi-transparent. I have found
some that were terminated by triedral pyramids. The crystals
are generally perpendicular to the sides of the vein. Small
crystals of the red often run from the vein of quartz into the
adjoining feldspar. The granite also contains minute crystals
of dark and light blue tourmaline, and pale green emerald,
with a very few garnets and pyrites. In the lower part
of the vein, five to six feet from its interruption by the mica
slate, the red tourmaline scarcely appears, and the vein contains
chiefly bluish amorphous quartz and green tourmaline.
It is therefore probable that this vein will not afford henceforward
a great supply of this beautiful mineral.</p>

<p>About six miles from Chesterfield, in Goshen, is found the
rose mica, with tourmalines and emeralds interspersed in the
granite. Unfortunately the bed of granite has not been discovered,
and the specimens we possess are taken from loose
rocks, scattered over a small extent of ground in a valley, in
the neighbourhood of mica slate. The rose mica is found in
a large grained granite with amorphous quartz and silicious
feldspar, crystallized and amorphous. The mica is generally
of a rose red, sometimes yellowish green. It crystallizes in
rhomboidal tables, rarely truncated on the acute angles,
passing into the hexaedral table. The tourmalines are light
and dark green and blue, of various shades of intensity, frequently
acicular and stellated. The black, the red, and the
violet tourmalines also occur, but more rarely. Sometimes
the green prisms enclose others of blue and black. Specific
gravity of these varieties from 3. to 3.1. The green and blue
crystals in this locality are translucid or semi-transparent.
The feldspar is generally white, rarely light blue. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
some emeralds in the granite. Among some specimens which
Mr. Weeks of New-York, who discovered this locality, was
so good as to give me, I found a beautiful rose emerald in its
matrix. It is a hexaedral prism, about one and a quarter inch
in diameter, the summit a plane, one of the lateral edges has
a truncature. About half of the diameter of the prism is free
from the matrix, and half an inch of the prism. The colour
is a pale rose, rather more transparent than the emerald.</p>

<p>The colour of the mica of the Goshen granite calls to mind
the lepidolite or lilalite, which (formerly considered as a
distinct species) has now been united to mica. The lepidolite
of Rosena is also accompanied by the tourmaline apyre, now
the red tourmaline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> &nbsp; <em>Observations on the Minerals connected with
the Gneiss range of Litchfield county, by Mr.</em> <span class="smcap">John P.
Brace</span>, <em>of Litchfield, Conn.</em></p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>he gneiss formation is the most extensive of any in Litchfield
county, and embraces a number of very interesting minerals.
It extends east into Hartford county. On the north it
runs into Massachusetts, though frequently interrupted by the
limestone formation, which rests upon it. It forms the principal,
and in many cases the only rock of the eastern and northeastern
sections of the county, and of the towns of Litchfield,
Goshen, Warren, Cornwall, and Norfolk. In Washington and
Canaan, it constitutes the rock of the high mountains, and is a
part of the same range in the other towns, while the valleys
and the more moderate elevations are covered with limestone.</p>

<p>The river Housatonic appears to have made its way through
this range, for the same rock continues on the western side
of the river parallel to it in the mountains of Kent, Sharon,
and Salisbury. In Litchfield commences a range of porphyritic
granite, or <em>porphyritic gneiss</em>, which alternates with the
common gneiss, and in some instances rests upon it. This rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
begins at Mount Prospect, between Litchfield and Warren, and
runs through South Farms, Bethlem, and Watertown. The
crystals of feldspar in it, are often very perfect.</p>

<p>The primitive granite, as a rock, is not found, though it lies
scattered on the surface in great quantities, and large masses.
The graphic granite in this region is often remarkably fine.
Mica slate constitutes a considerable part of those rocks that
rest on the gneiss, though never found in such elevated situations.
The mica slate rocks are always inclined at a great angle
with the horizon, and follow the direction of the other
range. Litchfield village, Chesnut hill, and great part of Harwington,
are entirely composed of this rock. The Bantum and
the Waterbury rivers have their bottoms of it. Some of the
brooks entering the Waterbury, have cut their passage through
the mica slate, leaving walls of 40 or 50 feet on each side, traversed
by veins of a very coarse-grained granite, and often
much mixed with sulphuret of iron. The slate near Harwington
meeting-house contains a great quantity of sulphuret of
iron. Mica slate likewise lies on the sides of the gneiss range
in Canaan and Salisbury, where it dips under the limestone.
<em>Sienite</em> is scattered on the surface in large masses, especially
where the porphyritic gneiss is found. Sometimes, however,
the masses are so large as to form mountains. Mount Tom,
between Litchfield and Washington, is of this nature, being
entirely composed of sienite, resting on gneiss. Slaty sienite
is frequently found, having a very large proportion of hornblende.</p>

<p>The minerals that are found in this region, are much more
interesting than its geology. In describing them, I shall confine
myself to the district east of the limestone range, intending
at some future time to investigate and describe the limestone
country.</p>

<p>Carbonate of lime, the granular limestone, is scattered over
the whole of this region. It often is found in the cavities of
decayed quartz rocks, and contains tremolite and augite.</p>

<p><em>Cyanite</em> or <em>Sappar</em>, is found in great quantities, especially in
Harwington and Litchfield. A crystalline mass of this was
found a few years ago, weighing probably 15 cwt.; it lay on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
mica slate ridge, and undoubtedly had been formerly imbedded
in the slate. Beautiful white talc, and small crystals of sulphuret
of iron, are disseminated in the mass. Specimens of
this mass are in almost all the cabinets in America. Smaller
masses have been found associated with feldspar. Small crystals
of this mineral are very common in mica slate, with staurotide
and garnet. Two of these crystals are often arranged
at right angles with each other. In Cornwall it is found in
small crystals in the gneiss containing graphite.</p>

<p><em>Staurotide</em> is very common and very beautiful. It is found
principally in mica slate, and exhibits often the cross. It most
generally is crystallized in four-sided prisms.</p>

<p><em>Quartz</em>, of course, is common. Cornwall particularly is distinguished
for the <em>smoky</em> variety. Ferruginous quartz is found
in rolled masses in the whole of this range.</p>

<p><em>Petro silex</em>, in rolled masses with ferruginous quartz, containing
veins of <em>chalcedony</em> and <em>hornstone</em>, and geodes of quartz
crystals, are common in Litchfield and Goshen. Sometimes
these masses in the interior assume the appearance of Burrstone.</p>

<p><em>Common opal</em> has been found in Litchfield, though rarely.
It was part of a mass of ferruginous quartz, with indelible
dendritic impression. It is very hard, and its fracture is conchoidal.</p>

<p><em>Mica</em> is very common. It is found green, white, and perfectly
black. It generally occurs in blocks of granite.</p>

<p><em>Schorl</em>, in rounded crystals, is found in all the granite in this
range; in radiating crystals on quartz; and in acicular crystals
on mica slate. The large crystals are so brittle, that few
of them can be obtained perfect. I once found it in Litchfield,
near Plymouth, in prismatic crystals on earthy graphite.</p>

<p>Feldspar is very common and beautiful in all the towns. It
is usually found in rhomboidal fragments, and has a fine lustre.
It is blue, white, and red. Some of the granite of Torringford
is very beautiful, being composed of white and smoky
quartz, red feldspar, and green mica. In the porphyritic
gneiss, feldspar is in six-sided prisms. One small crystal of
adularia, well defined, has been found by E. Wilkins, Esq.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Beryl</em>, both crystallized and massive, is often found in
Litchfield in granite. Its colours are green, greenish yellow,
pale yellow, and brown. Its crystals are often very perfect.</p>

<p><em>Garnets</em> are common in all the towns of this range.</p>

<p><em>Epidote.</em> Very beautiful crystals of this mineral have been
found in Washington, associated with feldspar. They are so
rounded as to render it very difficult to discover their form.
They have a very fine lustre, and are of an olive green; in
Litchfield, in crystals with hornblende, and graphic granite,
and in veins in sienite.</p>

<p>Perhaps no region can be found containing more beautiful
<em>tremolite</em>. All its varieties occur; the fibrous of Litchfield and
Bethlem is very distinguished. In Canaan, it is found containing
crystals of sulphuret of iron. I do not speak here of the
tremolite found in the limestone range.</p>

<p><em>Common asbestus</em> exists in Washington and New Milford.</p>

<p>The white <em>augite</em> is a mineral found in this range; in
Litchfield, in six-sided prisms very much flattened, on quartz,
and carbonate of lime with tremolite. They sometimes occur
several inches long.</p>

<p>The <em>lamellar</em> and <em>slaty</em> varieties of common <em>hornblende</em> are
very common.</p>

<p>Radiated <em>actynolite</em> of a beautiful bluish green in Litchfield;
in Canton of a brownish green.</p>

<p><em>Steatite</em> is common, and is quarried in Litchfield. The varieties
of <em>talc</em> are very common, connected with steatite, cyanite,
and chlorite.</p>

<p><em>Chlorite</em> in Litchfield, is found on quartz, with talc.</p>

<p>Porcelain clay in Litchfield in small quantities, and in Washington.</p>

<p><em>Graphite</em> is found in Cornwall in great quantities. Its gangue
is gneiss and sienite. It is lamellar, and has a metallic lustre;
is easily obtained, and might be made useful. Epidote and cyanite
are found with it.</p>

<p><em>Ores</em> are not common. Oxides of iron, and sulphuret of iron
are scattered over the whole range. Near Mount Prospect
in Litchfield, sulphuret of iron in mass is in great quantities;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and sulphate of iron on the surface of the ground near it. A
stone containing a few grains of <em>native copper</em> was found in
Litchfield.</p>

<p>The red oxyde of <em>titanium</em> occurs in Litchfield sparingly.
A very handsome specimen of the <em>reticulated oxyde of titanium</em>,
was picked up. It was on mica, and the mica had an evident
tendency towards the same form.</p>

angle the whole length between the joints. <em>Leaves</em> long, narrow,
and acute, scabrous on the margin and midrib. <em>Sheaths</em>
compressed, corresponding with the culm, shorter than the

tumid, attenuated beneath, flat on the interior side,
exteriorly convex, scabrous, and longitudinally striate. The
exterior valve of the calyx, in the perfect flowers, is ovate,
obtuse, very thick, cartilaginous, the inner margin inflected,
and deeply marked on its outer surface with from three to five
<em>corrugations</em>, with longitudinal ridges between them; the interior
valve is smaller, of equal length, acute, ruled, coriaceous,
smooth, and with the inner margin also inflected. The
valves of the corolla are membraneous, ovate, acute, white,
shorter than the calyx, the exterior one the longest. The
neutral florets are sometimes male, but most commonly consist
of nothing more than a 2-valved calyx, the valves equal, gaping,
scabrous, and much smaller than those of the perfect flower.

Florida."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs70">OBSERVATIONS.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that my description of this plant differs
<em>materially</em> from that of <em>Mr. Nuttall</em>. This has unavoidably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
arisen from <em>my</em> having attended to it in its living state, and from
<em>his</em> not availing himself of the information which it would have
afforded me pleasure to have communicated, had he done me
the favour to have requested it, or informed me of his wish to
publish an account of plants thus obtained. He has called the
culm <em>solid</em>, leaves <em>rather short</em>, spikes <em>cylindric</em>, <em>axillary</em>, the
flowers and rachis <em>entirely smooth</em>, pedicel of the neutral flower
<em>emarginate</em>, outer valve of the hermaphrodite calyx <em>acute</em>, the
valves of the corolla <em>obtuse</em>, and the styles <em>very short</em>. I have
not been able to confirm the above <em>characters</em>, nor do I find
them even in the dried specimens. Besides, he has omitted to
inform us that the rachis is <em>naked on one side</em>. This is a most
important and prominent <em>specific character</em>, the omission of
which would necessarily lead to much doubt in identifying the
species. What he means by stating that the "outer valve of
the hermaphrodite flower is 3-valved," I cannot imagine, nor
do I comprehend what is intended by an "exterior auxiliary
valve, or neutral rudiment; nearly the length of the calyx."
I have noticed in a single instance, connected <em>laterally</em> with the
corolla of the perfect flower, two very delicate, narrow, acute
pointed bodies, the length of the outer valve, and of the same
quality and appearance; but these I have considered as accidental,
and cannot perceive any thing about them like <em>neutral
rudiments</em>. Nor can I consider the articulations of the rachis
as "deeply excavated." They are, as already stated, flat on
the inner side, and constitute from their <em>flexuous</em> form, position,
and connexion with the pedicels of the neutral florets, an arch,
in which the perfect flowers are situated.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><i>Rottböllia ciliata.</i><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><em>Root</em> perennial. <i>Culm</i> two to four feet high, <em>generally</em> ramose,
solid, and terete, except that between the joints where
the branches originate, it is grooved on the inner side, and often
ciliate on its angles near the joints. The branches originate
towards the extremity, commonly from two to three in
number, each supporting a single terminal spike. <em>Leaves</em> very
narrow, acute, comparatively short, those beneath much the
longest, rigid, somewhat involute, and sharply serrulate towards
the apex. <em>Sheaths</em> rather shorter than the <em>internodes</em>,
open to the base, but closely embracing the culm. <em>Spikes</em> 3 to
5 inches long, the peduncles clothed with a very delicate acute
pointed sheath, which embraces it so closely as almost to elude
observation, varying much in length, but seldom extending to
the base of the spike. Peduncles scabrous near the spike.
<em>Flowers</em> alternate, the <em>male</em> or neutral florets situated on one
side of the rachis. <em>Rachis</em> compressed, slender, flexuous,
hairy on its exterior surface. Pedicel of the neutral florets
also compressed, and hairy on its exterior surface. <em>Valves</em> of
the calyx <em>nearly</em> equal, lanceolate, acute, coriaceous, polished,
the inner margin of each inflected. The exterior margin of
the outer valve finely <em>ciliate</em> towards the apex. <em>Valves</em> of the
corolla lanceolate, acute, membraneous, nearly the length of
the calyx. The male or neutral, are rather smaller than the
hermaphrodite flowers. <em>Stamens</em> 3, very short. <em>Anthers</em> twin,
purple. Styles 2, excerted, plumose, dark brown.</p>

<p>Discovered in flat pine barren on the north side of Satilla
river, in Georgia, on the 21st of October, 1815.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs70">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</p>

<p>These plants are unquestionably allied to <i>andropogon</i> in
their mode of flowering, but have nevertheless sufficient <em>essential
characters</em> to distinguish them. In <em>habit</em>, they appear but
slightly similar. They differ <em>principally</em> from their congeners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
in the pedicellate character of their neutral florets. <em>The spikes
are not axillary in either of them.</em> The branches are <em>axillary</em>,
of which several sometimes originate from the same axil in the
<i>R. corrugata</i>. Each spike, when fully evolved, is not only
<em>pedicellate</em>, but the <em>pedicel</em>, or peduncle, is connected with a
<i>culm</i> containing one, two, or more joints.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The culm is not
compressed, nor the leaves long in the <i>R. ciliata</i>, as stated by
<em>Mr. Nuttall</em>, who appears to have confounded the two species
in these, and some other instances. The joints of the rachis
in both are <em>fragile</em>, the joints of the culm in neither.</p>

<p>Another species noticed by Michaux, and included in all our
books as the <i>R. dimidiata, L.</i> has long been familiar to the southern
botanists. Whether this be the <i>dimidiata</i> found also on
the sandy shores of India, or the <i>compressa</i> of the same country,
as suggested by <em>Mr. Elliott</em>, or a species distinct from either,
I am not prepared to determine. But I have collected this
plant in the Bermudian Isles, at Rio de Janeiro, and Bahia, on
the Brazilian coast, and lastly on the island of Flores, near one
hundred miles from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, as well
as on the main in the Banda Oriental.</p>

<p>Vegetation has put forth more to appearance in three days
past than in all the spring before. Nature seems to revive
from a state of torpidity, from the warm and invigorating rays
of the sun. The month of May has been more backward than
the month of April, 1811. The observation of elderly people,
that the month of April, old style, was never known to terminate
without producing apple-blossoms, has by no means been
verified this year, they being now (June 1st.) in full flower.
The snow upon the mountains, thirty or forty miles back, is
at a great depth; so deep, that on the warm day of the 29th
our river rose a foot from its melting. Diseases of the chronic
kind have been peculiarly severe for three months past.
The gladsome return of the cheering warmth will probably
renovate the enfeebled constitutions of many of our aged
people.</p>

<p>It began to rain hard on the first of March, and continued
raining two days and a half, which nearly carried off an immense
body of snow which enveloped the ground. Our
rivers, which were more firmly locked with ice than they had
been before known for many years to be, rose above their
usual bounds, and swept the ice with such rapidity down their
channels as to destroy most of the bridges on Connecticut
river, besides doing immense damage in other respects. Our
meadows were nearly all under ice and water; and at that
time a great explosion was heard in the north meadows, two
miles from the street, similar to the noise of a cannon. It
was occasioned by the throwing up of an immense quantity of
frozen ground, which is a great curiosity. The cause is not
yet satisfactorily explained. The weather was very warm
and pleasant from the 4th to the 22d. What snow the rain
did not carry off was melted by the sun during the pleasant
weather. Vegetation had begun to put forth rapidly, and
many of our birds of passage had arrived. A storm, which
commenced on the 22d, as rapidly retarded the progress of
vegetation as it was before accelerated, and the remainder of
the month was gloomy and uncomfortable. Mud mid-leg deep

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">T</span>his genus was discovered in Pennsylvania, near Lancaster,
by the Rev. Dr. Muhlenberg, who communicated the same to
Wildenow of Berlin. This celebrated botanist ascertained that
it was a new genus, to which he gave the name of a German
botanist, (Floerke) and published it in the third volume of the
transactions of the society <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Curieux de la Nature</i> of Berlin,
for 1801, under the name of <i>Floerkea proserpinacoides</i>, which
long and uncouth specific name has been changed by every
subsequent author. Michaux has omitted it altogether, (with
many more American species) in his <cite>Flora Boreali Americana</cite>,
published in 1803. Persoon calls it <i>Floerkea lacustris</i>, in Syn.
plant. 1. p. 393. Muhlenberg <i>Floerkea uliginosa</i>, in Cat. pl.
Amer. Sept. p. 36. and Pursh, in Flora Amer. Sept. 1. p. 239,
unites it with the genus <i>Nectris</i>, and calls it <i>Nectris pinnata</i>, putting
it therefore in the Hexandria digynia of Linnæus, while all
the preceding authors had classed it in the Hexandria monogynia.
I will show presently which among them appear to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
wrong; but I must notice before, that no botanist had, I believe,
endeavoured to class it naturally, until Mr. Correa de
Serra, who in his <em>reduction of American genera to the natural
families of Jussieu</em>, attempted, without having had an opportunity
to see the plant, to place it in the family of <i>Junci</i>, taking
it therefore to be a monocotyle plant; being led into this error
by a mistaken idea, that all hexandrous plants must be
monocotyle! But in the spring of 1816, I found this plant in
the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, (near the falls of the
Schuylkill) where it had escaped the attention of all the botanists
of that city, and in particular of Dr. William Barton,
who has therefore omitted it in his Prodr. fl. Philad. and having
communicated it to Mr. Correa, he acknowledged that it
was dicotyle, of which fact I was aware, even before seeing
the plant and dissecting its seed, by attending to its habit.</p>

<p>The following exact description of this genus will enable
the reader to ascertain how far I am correct in my presumptions
towards its natural arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Floerkea.</i> Perigone double persistent, sixpartite; the exterior
calicinal 3 partile, sepals acute; the interior shorter,
coloured 3 partile, sepals petaloid, oblong, obtuse. Six stamens
perigyne, filaments filiform, of the length of the interior sepals,
anthers round. One free ovarium, rounded and bilobed, one
central and bifod style, two capitated stigmas. Fruit a bilobed
atricule, tuberculated and bilocular dispermous, sometimes
round, unilocular and monospermous by abortion of one lobe
and cell. Seeds attached to the centre near the bottom, nearly
lenticular, smooth albuminous, easily divided in two lobes.
<em>Habit.</em> Small, delicate, annual, and glabrous plant, with alternate
polytome pinnated leaves, flowers axillar, solitary, pedunculated.</p>

<p><i>Floerkea uliginosa.</i> Caule tenello flaccido erecto simplex,
foliis 4 petiolatis imis ternatis, summis pinnato, quinatis, pinnulis
lineari oblongis obtusis, integris floribus axillaris, solitaris
pedunculis longis apice incrastatis. Stem delicate, soft, upright,
and simple, leaves petiolated, the inferior ternated, the
superior pinnated, quinate, pinnules linear-oblong obtuse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
flowers axillar, solitary, and on long peduncles, swelled under
the flower.</p>

<p>Among the several specific names given to this plant, I prefer
Muhlenberg's, as it expresses exactly the kind of situations
where it grows, say in moist grounds, occasionally swampish or
overflowed; those I found near Philadelphia, grew by thousands
on the banks of a small brook in a wood below the left
side of the falls of Schuylkill. Persoon's name of <i>lacustris</i>,
being wrong, as it would seem to imply that it grows in lakes
only; and Wildenow's name being too long and illusive, its
similarity of habit with the genus <i>Proserpinaca</i> not being very
striking. However, even the name of <i>uliginosa</i> is liable to
some slight objection; and did I think myself permitted to coin
a new name, while so many have been proposed already, I
should have called it either <i>F. tenella</i>, or <i>F. flaccida</i>, or <i>F. olitoria</i>,
being a very delicate and tender plant, and very good
to eat in sallad, as I have tried it myself, its taste is sweet and
pleasant, the whole plant may be eaten, (even the root) being
all juicy and tender: it grows in such an abundance in some
spots, that it might occasionally afford a most precious and delightful
sallad, but if cultivated for that purpose, it might be
found an agreeable addition to our culinary herbs.</p>

<p>In addition to my above definition, it will be proper to state
that the stem of this plant rises from 4 to 8 inches, it is cylindrical,
smooth, and yellowish, the middle leaves are the largest,
the lower peduncles are longer than the leaves, and the upper
ones shorter, the petals or interior sepals, and the stamens are
yellow. It blossoms in May, and is annual, it even lasts only
three months.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that I do not agree with Mr. Pursh, in
uniting this plant with the genus <i>Nectris</i>: he owns himself that
it deviates a <em>little</em> from the generic character of <i>Nectris</i>, but
these deviations appear to me very material; they exist in the
pistils and fruits, the most essential parts of the flowers, since
they agree in the perigone and stamens. The genus <i>Nectris</i>
(or <i>Calomba</i> of Aublet) has <em>two ovaries</em>, <em>two styles</em>, and <em>two polispermous
capsules</em>, or <em>achens</em>! and belongs therefore to the
second order <i>Perimesia</i>, (class <i>Eltrogynia</i>) eighth family <i>Achenopsia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
next to the genus <i>Myriophyllum</i>: while the genus Floerkea
which has a <em>bilobed ovary</em>, <em>one central style</em>, <em>two stigmas</em>,
and <em>one bilocular dispermous achen</em>, must belong to the eleventh
order of the same class; <i>Isostimia</i>, which is characterized by
having more than one stigma, the stamens in regular number,
and not central; it will form a connecting link between this
order and the foregoing <i>Polymesia</i>, by its affinity with many genera
of the <i>Euphorbia's</i> tribe, such as <i>Callitriche</i>, <i>Tragia</i>, <i>Mercurialis</i>,
&amp;c. from which it differs merely by having hermaphrodite
flowers, and perispheric regular stamens. It will at
present stand nearly isolated in this order, where it may form
the small family <i>Galenidia</i>, along with the genus <i>Galenia</i>, &amp;c.
and which shall have much affinity with the family <i>Phytolacia</i>;
but this differs by having a multilocular berry, while the <i>Galenia</i>
merely differs by having a 4 sided perigone, 8 stamens,
and 2 styles.</p>

<p>I admit, however, that there is a strong affinity between the
genera <i>Floerkea</i> and <i>Nectris</i>, but stronger affinities often exist
in plants of different classes. If, however, it should happen
that Aublet<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> might have been mistaken in describing the ovaries
and capsules of the <i>Nectris</i> as double, if they should prove
to be simple but bilobed, then the <i>Nectris</i> would belong to the
same family as the <i>Floerkea</i>; but yet stand as a peculiar genus
distinguished by having 2 styles, and the achens not monospermous!</p>

<p>It was insinuated to me by Mr. Correa, that the <i>Floerkea</i>
might have some affinity with the tribe of <i>Ranunculaceous</i>, but
I cannot discover any, since that tribe is widely different, by
having many ovaries, stamens, and fruits, each ovary with 1
style or stigma, a deciduous perigone, the anthers adnate, &amp;c.
The analogy in the structure of the seed and habit, is too slight
to be taken in consideration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> &nbsp; <em>Descriptions of Three New Genera of Plants,
from the State of New-York. Cylactis, Nemopanthus,
and Polanisia, by</em> <span class="smcap">C. S. Rafinesque</span>.</p></div>


<p class="p1 center">1. <em>N. G. Cylactis.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">C</span>alyx campanulated 6 to 10 fidus, sepals a little unequal.
Petals 4 to 6 equal. Many perigynous stamens. Pistils 8 to
12, ovaries sessile ovate, styles elongated, stigmas capitated.
Berries few, distinct, one seeded.</p>

<p>This new genus belongs in the analytical and natural method,
(see Analysis of Nature) to the first natural class <i>Eltrogynia</i>,
first natural order <i>Rhodanthia</i>, second natural family
<i>Senticosia</i>, next to the genera <i>Rubus</i>, <i>Oligacis</i>, &amp;c. It would
range itself into the artificial class <i>Icosandria</i> of the Linnæan
sexual system; but not properly into any of its orders, since
the number of pistils is variable, and never above 12. Only
one species belongs to it, which I have discovered in company
with Mr. Knevels, on the Catskill mountains. The etymology
of the name derives from two Greek words meaning <i>radiated
calyx</i>. It differs essentially from <i>Rubus</i> by the unequal many
cleft calyx, variable petals, and few pistils.</p>

<p><i>Cylactis montana.</i> Mountain cylactis&mdash;Stem herbaceous upright,
unarmed, pubescent; leaves quinate, nearly smooth,
upper ones sessile, stipules oblong, folioles ovate acuminate,
incised, serrated, ciliated, base acute, entire, the middle one
petiolated: flowers few corymbose, peduncles erect elongated
bracteolated; calyx pubescent, sepals lanceolate acute,
nerved, reflexed; petals cuneate-obovate, longer than the
calyx.</p>

<p>It is a small perennial plant, rising about half a foot; flowers
white, blossoming in June. On the Catskill mountains near
the great falls, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="p1 center">2. <i>N. G. Nemopanthus.</i></p>

<p>Dioical. M. flowers calyx 5 phylle, equal, deciduous. No
corolla. Stamina 5 hypogynous, alternating with the calyx.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Fem. fl. calyx deciduous 5 phylle? Ovary ovate, stigma sessile
4 lobed. Berry 4 celled 4 seeded.</p>

<p>The name means <em>flower with a filiform peduncle</em>. A shrub
forms this genus, which had perhaps been united with <i>ilex</i> by
Michaux, &amp;c.; but it differs altogether from it by the want of
corolla, hypogynous stamens, sessile, style, &amp;c. it does not
even belong to the same family, but to the natural family
<i>Rhamnidia</i>, natural order <i>Plynontia</i>, and natural class <i>Eltrogynia</i>,
next to the genus <i>frangula</i>. In the sexual system it would
belong to <i>Dioecia pentandria</i>, very far apart from <i>Frangula</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nemopanthus fascicularis.</i> Fascicled nemopanthus. Shrubby,
leaves fasciculated, petiolate, oblong, mucronate, entire,
rather undulated, membranaceous, smooth; flowers axillary
fasciculated, peduncles filiform, shorter than the leaves.</p>

<p>It forms a small shrub from 5 to 8 feet high, covered with
gray bark, and with slender upright branches; the flowers are
greenish, very small, the female flowers have shorter and
thicker peduncles; they blossom in June. It grows on the
Catskill mountains near the two lakes. It is, perhaps, the
<i>Ilex canadensis</i>? of Michaux and Pursh. And it has some analogy
with the <i>Frangula alnifolia</i>.</p>


<p class="p1 center">3. <i>N. G. Polanisia.</i></p>

<p>Calyx 4 phylle, phylles coloured unequal, the upper one
unguiculated spatulated. Corolla with 4 unequal petals, the
two upper ones larger and unguiculated. A nectarium upwards
glandular, broad, and truncated. Stamina 9 to 14, unequal,
erect, hypogynous. Ovary oblong on a short pedicel,
one style, one truncated stigma. Fruit a follicular capsule, one
celled, two valved, many seeded, seeds inserted on each side
of each suture, nearly snail-shaped.</p>

<p>The type of this genus is the <i>Cleome dodecandra</i> of Linnæus,
under which denomination many species were blended, which
have no similitude with the real genus <i>cleome</i>, differing in the
calyx, corolla, nectarium, stamina, and fruit. I shall describe
here that of North America, where 2 or 3 species exist, besides
those of the West Indies, Africa, and Asia, which are totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
different. The etymology of the name which I have given to
it, derives from <em>many irregularities</em>. It belongs in the analytical
method of botany, to the first natural class <i>Eltrogynia</i>, ninth natural
order <i>Monostimia</i>, natural family <i>Capparidia</i>. It can find
no place in the sexual system since the number of stamina varies
from 9 to 14, unless it be forced into <i>Dodecandria</i>.</p>

<p><i>Polanisia graveolens.</i> Clammy polanisia&mdash;hairy and glutinous
all over, stem upright, leaves alternate, petiolate, ternated,
folioles sessile, the intermediate longest, oblong, obtuse, entire,
hairy on the margin and nerves: flowers racemose erect,
bracteas petiolate, ovate, obtuse, calyx hairy, petals emarginate,
crenate, capsules divaricate glutinous.</p>

<p>It is the <i>Cleome dodecandra</i> of Michaux and Pursh. It grows
on the banks of rivers and lakes, on the Hudson near Newburgh,
on the Susquehannah near Harrisburg, on Lake Erie,
on the Ohio, and Mississippi, &amp;c. It blossoms in July and August,
the stem rises about 1 foot, the petals are white, or
slightly red. The whole plant has a strong graveolent smell,
similar to that of <i>Erigeron graveolens</i>. (Received January,
1818. <em>Editor.</em>)</p>

<p class="right">E. IVES.</p>


<p>This plant was first observed by me, in company with Mr.
C. Whitlow, in July, 1817, by the margin of a brook, a few
rods north of Mr. E. Whitney's gun manufactory, near New-Haven.
It is also found on the margin of the Housatonick,
about thirty miles from Long Island sound, where it was observed
by Dr. Alfred Monson, the last summer. Specimens
of this plant were sent to Z. Collins, Esq. of Philadelphia, for
the purpose of comparing it with the species of gnaphalium in
Muhlenberg's herbarium, more particularly with the <i>luteo-album</i>
and <i>Pennsylvanicum</i>, which I had not seen.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the politeness of Mr. Collins, for the facts
on this subject relative to Muhlenberg's herbarium. He observes,
"your Gnaphalium is certainly not the <i>luteo-album</i> of
Muhlenberg, which may not strictly be a native, but introduced.
Yours most approaches G. polycephalum Mx. Still,
from the decurrent leaves and other differential marks, it
appears to me to be a new species. Muhlenberg's collection
has it not."</p>

<p>As the <i>luteo-album</i> is said to grow in New-England, yet so
far as my observation has extended it has not been found by
any of the botanists, I am induced to believe that this opinion
has arisen from some erroneous description of the plant which
is the subject of this paper.</p>

<p>As the decurrent leaves of this Gnaphalium distinguish it so
obviously from all the other American species of Gnaphalium,
I propose to give it the specific name of <i>decurrens</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>f the following descriptions and notices of some of the
animal productions of our country, chiefly fossil, and of which
some are but little known, should be found of sufficient interest
to occupy a place in the Journal of Science, they are
very much at your service for that work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>The greater portion of them are extracted, with some modification,
from an essay which I read about three years ago, to
the Academy of Natural Sciences, without any intention at the
time of giving publicity to them. But the rapid diffusion of a
taste for geological research, seems to require corresponding
exertions on the part of those who have attended to fossil remains,
inasmuch as geology, in order to be eminently furnished
with every advantage that may tend to the developement
of many important results, must be in part founded on a
knowledge of the different genera and species of reliquiæ,
which the various accessible strata of the earth present. The
accessory value of this species of knowledge, is now duly estimated
in Europe, as affording the most obvious means of estimating,
with the greatest approximation to truth, the comparative
antiquity of formations, and of strata, as well as of identifying
those with each other which are in their nature similar.</p>

<p>Certainly very little is yet known about the fossils of North
America, and very little can be known accurately, until we
shall have it in our power to compare them with approved
detailed descriptions, plates, or specimens of those of Europe;
which have been made known to the world by the indefatigable
industry, and scientific research of Lamarck and other
naturalists.</p>

<p>America is rich in fossils. In many districts of the United
States, vast beds of fossil shells, zoophytes, &amp;c. are deposited,
which, for the most part, are concealed from the inquiring eye,
offering superficially a mere confused mass of mutilated fragments.
These rich repositories must finally be exposed to
view, by the onward pace of improvement, and the more interior
strata will be unveiled by some fortunate profound excavations,
the result of enterprise in the pursuit of gain. The
very surface of the country in many regions, is almost overspread
with the abundance of casts, or redintigrate fossils, many
of which are apparently specifically anomalous, and some generically
so. The correct, and only useful mode in which the
investigation of our fossils can be conducted, is attended with
some difficulty and labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>The task presumes the knowledge, not only of fossils in all
their different states, from the apparently unchanged specimen,
to the fragment or section of a cast uninsulably imbedded in its
rocky matrix, but it also requires an adequate acquaintance with
recent specimens, or those of which the inhabitants are not
yet struck from the list of animated beings, in other words
those of the present, as well as those of the former world.</p>

<p>Due advantage being taken of the many opportunities which
are from time to time offered to us, of obtaining knowledge in
this department, will probably be the means of producing a list
of American animal reliquiæ, coextensive with that of Europe
at the present day. In the present state of the science, however,
the correct naturalist will feel it a duty which he owes
to his colaborators to proceed with the utmost caution, that he
may not add unnecessarily to the already numerous species.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><i>Genus Alveolites, Lam.</i></p>

<p>Coral lapideous, covering extraneous bodies, or in a simple
mass, formed of concentric strata; strata composed each of a
union of numerous alveoles, which are very short, contiguous,
reticulate, and generally parallel.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Species.</em></p>

<p><i>A. glomeratus</i>, alveoles vertical, subequal, oval, or obsoletely
hexagonal, much shorter than the diameter, parallel; paries
simple; strata numerous, forming a rounded mass. (<em>Cabinet
of the Academy of Natural Sciences.</em>)</p>

<p>Found often on the coast of North America, cast up by the
waves, the animals sometimes still living. Forms masses of
various sizes and figures, generally more or less rounded or
lobed, and composed of a great number of concentric layers.
The number of these strata seems to be regulated in some degree,
by the quantity of surface they have to cover. Thus if
the nucleus happens to be a small shell, such as the <i>Naticæ</i>,
<i>Nassæ</i>, &amp;c. of our coast, or even the oyster, (<i>O. virginica</i>,)
clam, (<i>V. mercenaria</i>,) &amp;c. the strata are often very numerous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
but on the thoracic plate of <i>Limulus polyphemus</i>, having a considerable
space over which to extend themselves, the strata
are but few, not more than 2 or 3. I have seen the thoracic
plate of this animal so entirely covered by the <i>Alveolite</i>, as to
have the eyes and stemmata concealed so as to be perfectly
blind. When composed of a single layer only, it much resembles
a <i>Flustra</i>, or a <i>Cellapore</i> of which the convex surfaces have
been removed by attrition. The animal I have not yet examined.
The alveoles or cells of a layer, are arranged in lines
of different degrees of curvature, obscurely radiating from different
centres; these lines are placed side by side, the alveoles
alternating with each other throughout the layer in a
quincunx manner; the thickness of the paries is somewhat
equal to one half of the conjugate diameter of the alveole, the
length of which, or thickness of the layer, is scarcely more
considerable; but these proportions vary.</p>

<p>The species to which it seems allied, are <i>madreporacea</i> and
<i>incrustans</i>. The former is fossil, and differs in being subramose;
the latter forms but a single expansion.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><i>Genus Favosites, Lam.</i></p>

<p>Coral lapideous, simple, of a variable form, composed of
parallel prismatic and fasciculated tubes; tubes contiguous,
pentagonal, or hexagonal, more or less angular, rarely articulated.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Species.</em></p>

<p><i>F. striata</i>, more or less turbinate; <i>paries of the alveoles</i>
longitudinally striated within, and fenestrate with minute osculi;
<i>alveoles</i> with very numerous septæ. (<em>Cabinet Acad. Nat.
Sciences; and Peale's Museum&mdash;common.</em>)</p>

<p>Found fossil in various parts of the United States, at the
falls of the Ohio; Genessee, New-York; Pittsburg and Wilksbarre,
Pennsylvania; Missouri, &amp;c. &amp;c. but not yet in the
alluvial deposit of New-Jersey.</p>

<p>The tubes are generally, partially, or entirely filled with
silicious matter, sometimes so completely so, as to resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
in miniature, basaltic columns; when the alveoles are free on
the surface, these fossils are known by the name of <em>petrified
wasp-nests</em>, from the resemblance they bear to the nests of those
insects. The silex is usually only infiltrated into the cavities,
leaving the substance of the coral in its original calcareous
state, but the specimens which are found amongst the rolled
pebbles of the Delaware River, near Philadelphia, are completely
silicified.</p>

<p>The size varies from one fourth of an ounce, to two hundred
pounds or more, and the tubes occur of every intermediate
diameter, from the fortieth to one fourth of an inch. It
is not common to find any two specimens of like form, they
are, however, ordinarily more or less turbinate, but are sometimes
depressed or compressed, and the tubes rectilinear or
excurved, and of various lengths. The dilated summit is not
so much the effect of a gradual enlargement of the tubes, as
of the frequent and adventitious interposition of young ones,
which of course renders the openings of the tubes unequal.
The tubes or alveoles, vary in the same coral, being 5 or 6,
rarely seven sided, but the hexagonal form is most common;
the interior of a tube is divided into a great number of apartments
or cells, by approximate transverse septæ, each of the
cells appears to be connected with the corresponding cells of
the surrounding tubes, by lateral orifices in the dividing paries;
these orifices are minute, inequidistant, orbicular, their margins
slightly prominent, and forming from one to three longitudinal
series on each side of the tube; each row is separated from
the adjoining one by an impressed line. By means of these
osculi it seems probable that all the animals inhabiting a common
coral, were connected together, or had free communication
with each other, but whether by means of a common organ
as in <i>Pyrosoma</i>, <i>Stephanomia</i>, &amp;c. or simply by contact as in
the aggregating <i>Salpa</i>, &amp;c. we have no means of determining.</p>

<p>The <em>striata</em> differs from <i>Madrepora truncata</i>, Esper. (<i>F. alveolata</i>,
Lam.) in not being "extùs transversè sulcata." It
seems to be allied to <i>Corallium Gothlandicum</i>, Amœn. Acad.
v. 1. p. 106, and it is possible it may prove synonymous, or
very similar to it, when that species becomes better known;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
the latter has been taken for Basalt, and M. Lamarck when
describing it, inquires <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Est-ce un polypier?"</span> <i>Madrepora
fascicularis</i>, of Volck. and Parkin. in common with <i>F. striata</i>
and <i>F. Gothlandicum</i>, is distinguished by the transverse septa,
a character which induced me to refer the species here described
to <i>Favosite</i>; they seem therefore to be congeneric, as
analogy indicates a participation in the character of osculated
paries.</p>

<p>Amongst the great variety exhibited by this species, we
have to remark more particularly the following, viz.:</p>

<p>1st. Alveoles perfectly free, that is, destitute of aciculi
or lamellæ, the septa wanting, and sometimes the osculi obsolete.</p>

<p>2d. Alveoles filled almost to the summit with the septa, and
resembling those combs of the bee-hive which are filled with
honey and covered over.</p>

<p>3d. Paries beset with very numerous, interrupted, alternating,
transverse lamellæ, which are denticulated at their
tips, and project towards the centre with various degrees of
prominence and irregularity.</p>

<p>The first variety corresponds with the generic character,
and the third approaches the genus <i>Porites</i>; yet so unequivocally
identical are they, that I have seen them all united in
the same mass, and perforated throughout by the osculi. The
identity is further obvious by the perfect gradation which
renders them inseparable.</p>

<p>With respect to the transverse septa, I think their presence
may be accounted for by supposing that as the animal elongates
its tube in consequence of an increase of growth, or in order
to maintain an equal elevation with the adjacent tubes, (rendered
necessary by the origin of young tubes in the interstices)
it gradually vacates the basal portions of its tube, and sustains
itself at the different elevations, by successively uniting the
parietal lamellæ so as to exclude the vacuity. That this is probable,
we may infer from a similar procedure on the part
of several species of testaceous mollusca. Thus some Linnæan
<i>Serpula</i> become camerated, and a familiar instance presents
itself in the <i>Triton tritonis</i>, the animal of which adds suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>cessive
partitions to the interior of the spire, as that part becomes
too strait for the increasing volume of its body. If the
above supposition proves correct, the organs of communication
which pass through the osculi, can hardly be in common, but
must rather connect the animals by simple contact only, otherwise
these parts would be broken when the animal changes its
place by vacating the inferior part of the tube.</p>

<p>The third variety is then the state of that portion of the
tube which is inhabited by the body of the animal, and not yet
interrupted by the septæ.</p>

<p>From the above observations, it is evident that this species,
and probably the entire genus <i>Favosite</i> under which I have
placed it, will not arrange properly with the <i>Tubipores</i>, <i>Millepores</i>,
&amp;c. but must be transferred to the <i>Polypiers Lamellifères</i>
of Lamarck. And if the <i>Madrepora retepora</i> of Solander and
Ellis, is a true <i>Porites</i>, as M. Lamarck supposes it to be from
the appearance of its tubes, I should conclude this genus to be
very proximately allied to <i>Favosites</i>, by that species and the
<i>F. striata</i> having in common the remarkable character of
fenestrated paries. But to this character I should conceive a
generic importance ought to be attached, as indicating a differential
organization of the artificers. I have no doubt that on
close inspection of a perfect specimen, the same character
will be found to exist in <i>F. Gothlandicum</i>, and possibly also in
<i>F. truncata</i>, if not in the latter only, it may be proper to separate
the genus and to withdraw from <i>Porites</i> the forementioned
species, retaining to <i>striata</i> as specifically essential, the
second member of the differential description.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">M</span>eteorology is a science of so much general concern,
that it seems to be incumbent upon every member of society
to aid in augmenting the stock of facts, which the labours of
ingenious and scientific men have already accumulated on that
subject. Under this impression I propose to devote the following
paper to some observations on <em>salt winds</em> or <em>storms</em>, as
they have occurred in this country and in Europe&mdash;a subject,
which although presenting many phenomena of a more than
temporary interest, has as yet excited but little attention.
Indeed, the opportunities for observation have occurred so
rarely as readily to account for its having in a great measure
escaped the philosophical acumen of the present age.</p>

<p>It must have been early observed that the atmosphere in
the vicinity of the sea frequently becomes impregnated with
saline materials; but the first and only account of a <em>salt storm</em>
that I have met with, is to be found in the Transactions of the
Linnæan Society of London. The 8th volume of that work
gives an interesting narration of the effects of a storm of this
description, which occurred in England, in January, 1803. It
was occasioned by an east wind, which blew for some days,
and which, in its passage over the ocean, had imbibed large
quantities of salt water, which were afterward deposited upon
the land. In most cases these depositions proved fatal to the
plants and vegetables which received them. So extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
were the effects of this singular storm, that they were felt in
the vicinity of London, at a distance of about seventy miles
from the ocean, and in all the intermediate country. In most
instances, the leaves of the plants, which suffered from it,
appeared as if they had been scorched, and in some places
even the tops of the branches mortified. A storm of the same
kind took place in England, in February, 1804; and the memoir
states, that Sir Joseph Banks had noticed another some
years before in Lincolnshire.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>A storm attended with similar effects occurred in this country
in 1815, and vented its fury upon the eastern states. It
commenced on the 23d of September, between eight and nine
o'clock, A. M. with the wind from the east. In about two
hours the wind shifted to southeast, and blew a perfect hurricane.
The extended devastation which ensued, is still in
the recollection of every person. The tides rose from nine
to twelve feet higher than ordinary, and in many of the principal
cities and towns along the coast of New England,
churches, houses, bridges, wharves, and in some instances
valuable citizens, were buried in one common ruin. In less
than three hours the gale abated, and before sunset there was
a perfect calm. Such were the more striking features of this
tremendous gale&mdash;but other effects were observed more peculiarly
interesting to the philosopher. At New-London, Salem,
and other places, both on the coast, and several miles in the
interior, the air was found to be loaded with salt; and the
leaves of many trees appeared, a few hours after the storm,
as if they had been scorched. Besides this effect upon
vegetables, there were additional evidences of the saline
quality of the wind. At Salem and some other places an
incrustation of salt was perceived on the windows, and the
fruit in several gardens had a perceptible taste of salt on
their surface. At New-London it was remarked that the air
in the eddies was extremely hot and suffocating.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>
<p>Other facts of a similar nature might be collected, but these
it is presumed are sufficient to characterize the state of the
atmosphere during that storm.</p>

<p>Several interesting inquiries arise from the consideration of
the foregoing facts.</p>

<p>1. In what way does the salt exist in the atmosphere in
these storms? On this point there are two different opinions.
The most prevalent is, that it is merely the spray of the sea
driven onward by the force of the wind. This opinion has
received the sanction of Sir Joseph Banks,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and also of Sir
Humphry Davy, if we may judge from an incidental expression
in his Agricultural Chemistry.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Another opinion<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> is,
that muriate of soda is continually rising into the atmosphere
from the surface of the ocean, and that the air, in all maritime
situations, is thus constantly more or less impregnated with salt.
The most striking fact in support of this doctrine, (so opposite
to the commonly received views on the subject of the evaporation
of sea water) is the actual existence of muriate of soda
in the rain and snow which fall in the vicinity of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
The experiments of Vogel and Bouillon Lagrange, on the
distillation of sea water, are also in favour of the position, that
salt may be carried into the air in the ordinary process of
evaporation. On distilling salt water they found a considerable
quantity of muriate of soda in the receiver.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>Admitting the correctness of these experiments, still it is
not easy to conceive, how they will account satisfactorily for
the <em>large</em> quantities of salt found in the air during the storms
under consideration.</p>

<p>Whichever of these solutions may be adopted, it is unquestionably
a fact that salt does, in some way or other, exist in
the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of the sea.</p>

<p>2. The next object of inquiry is, the influence which this
saline air has upon vegetable life. Independently of the facts
already stated, there are many others which prove its deleterious
agency upon the vegetable creation. Dr. Mitchill
informs me, that in some parts of the south side of Long-Island
fruit trees do not thrive well, except at a distance of thirty
miles from the sea, and even the sturdy oak does not extend
its branches towards the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> If I am correctly informed,
it was with great difficulty, that the trees on our Battery were
made to accommodate themselves to a situation so near the
salt water. It is also well known, that when plants are taken
to sea, they speedily perish, if exposed but a short time to a
wind, which is sufficiently strong to turn over the tops of the
waves into <em>white caps</em>, as they are called by the sailors.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain positively, whether these effects were
to be attributed to the operation of salt, I made a solution of
muriate of soda in common rain water; with this I watered
for a couple of days the leaves of different plants. In a short
time they began to dry up, and in a few days were completely
dead.</p>

<p>It appears from Volney, that the Egyptian air is strongly
charged with salts. The evidences of it are to be found even
at Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is this property of the air, which this philosophical
traveller considers, as one of the causes of the rapid
vegetation in that country. He mentions, however, that <em>exotic</em>
plants will not thrive there. It is found necessary to renew
the seeds of them every year. May not this be occasioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>by the saline quality of the air? The <em>native</em> plants are
doubtless accustomed to its action, and do not so sensibly feel
its injurious effects. And if the Egyptian air is so very penetrating
from this very cause, as to produce ophthalmia, may
we not rationally conclude, that its influence must be equally
injurious to plants not accustomed to it.</p>

<p>Another illustration of the influence of salt on vegetation is
to be found in the <em>Dead Sea</em>, or <em>Lake Asphaltites</em>. "In Lake
Asphaltites," says Volney, "there is neither animal nor
vegetable life. No verdure is to be seen on its banks, nor
fish to be found within its waters; but it is not true, that its
exhalations are pestiferous, so as to destroy birds flying over
it. It is not uncommon to see swallows skimming its surface,
and dipping for the water necessary to build their nests. The
<em>true</em> cause which deprives it of vegetables and animals is the
extreme saltness of the water, which is vastly stronger than
that of the sea. The soil around it, equally impregnated with
this salt, produces no plants, and the <em>air</em> itself, which becomes
loaded with it from evaporation, and which receives also the
sulphureous and bituminous vapours, cannot be favourable to
vegetation; hence the deadly aspect which reigns around this
lake."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>3. In what way does the salt operate in producing its
deleterious effects on the leaves of vegetables? It is by no
means easy to answer this question. It cannot be by shutting
up the pores of the leaf, and thus obstructing its perspiration.
It is well known that when the surfaces of leaves are covered
with oil, they will soon die.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> But salt water is certainly not
sufficiently viscid to act in a similar way.</p>

<p>Nor can it be satisfactorily attributed to the difference
of structure between maritime and land plants. There is
some difference indeed between many of these, maritime
plants being generally covered by a pubescence, of which
most land plants are destitute. It is idle however to suppose
that the object of this covering is to protect maritime plants
from the action of the salt air, as there are many of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>which do not possess it. Besides, is it not rational to conclude,
from the large quantities of soda which are always
found in sea plants, that this saline atmosphere is rather propitious
than otherwise to their growth, and that it only proves
injurious to plants accustomed to the unadulterated air of the
land.</p>

<p>Again, I do not think that it can be explained by supposing,
that the salt is absorbed into the plant, and thus acts as a poisonous
substance. We know, that in land plants which are
cultivated in the neighbourhood of the sea, salt is absorbed
through their roots.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It must of course circulate with the
juices through the whole plant; and yet in these cases the
leaves are not destroyed by it.</p>

<p>The most plausible method of explaining it appears to be
this: that the salt, by its irritating or corrosive power, destroys
the small vessels in the leaf which are necessary for the circulation
going on in it during health.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin has ingeniously shown the analogy between the
functions of the leaves of plants, and the lungs of animals. If
this be admitted, it will not be difficult to account for the
action of salt upon leaves. This substance, when taken into
the stomach, proves not merely innocuous, but wholesome;
but when accidentally introduced into the lungs, irritation,
inflammation, and death are the consequences. So with
plants&mdash;when admitted into them in combination with their
juices, it may be harmless; but when applied to the lungs or
leaves, death ensues.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>
<p>4. I shall devote the remainder of this paper to a few concise
observations on the effects of salt, and a saline atmosphere,
upon <em>animal</em> life.</p>

<p>Upon the more imperfect animals, such as slugs, worms,
toads, &amp;c. it is well known that salt proves speedily destructive
of life. It is not my intention to attempt an explanation
of this singular fact. But it is remarkable that it should not
have been turned to better account in the treatment of those
worms, which infest the human body. Although used for that
purpose by the common people in Ireland as well as in this
country, I believe it has not, until very lately, claimed the
attention of the profession, as an anthelmintick. A late English
journal<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> contains a notice of some cases which satisfactorily
prove its efficacy, when administered with this intention.
This fact, in addition to numerous others, strikingly illustrates
the advantages which the healing art might derive from
a careful observation of the phenomena daily developed by
the collateral sciences.</p>

<p>In cases of <em>hæmoptysis</em> and <em>hæmatemesis</em>, common salt has
been used with decided success. The public is indebted to
Dr. Rush, for the introduction of this remedy into general
practice.</p>

<p>Dr. Hosack informs me, that he has found sea air extremely
salutary in <em>remittent fever</em>, <em>cholera infantum</em>, and <em>dyspepsia</em>.</p>

<p>Among the deleterious effects caused by a <em>saline atmosphere</em>,
may be mentioned the <em>ophthalmia</em> of Egypt. This disease is
so common there, "that out of a hundred persons," says Volney,
"I have met while walking the streets of Cairo, twenty have
been quite blind, ten wanting an eye, and twenty others have
had their eyes red, purulent, or blemished."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Throughout
the Delta, and at Cairo, this complaint is more prevalent than
in any other part of Egypt. In Syria it is also common, although
less so than in Egypt, but it is only met with on the
<em>sea-coast</em>. The reasoning of Volney on this subject, is decisive
of the position, that the prevalence of this complaint, in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>regions, is owing to their proximity to the ocean. In confirmation,
he states that he has himself experienced the irritating
effects of the air of the Delta upon the organ of vision.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In those cases of <em>scurvy</em> which occur in long voyages, the
saline nature of the atmosphere co-operates very powerfully
with salt provisions and bad water, in producing that general
vitiation of the system which characterizes this disorder.</p>

<p>Of all diseases, however, those of the lungs appear to be
most affected by a saline air. I have known a lady of this
city who had been afflicted for many years with <em>asthma</em>, to be
essentially benefited by a voyage across the Atlantic. Another
case has fallen under my observation, of a lady troubled with
asthma, being much relieved by removing from the interior
to this city. What proves beyond a doubt that her relief
is owing to the air she breathes, is, that whenever she takes a
jaunt into the country, she is sure to suffer a paroxysm of her
old complaint.</p>

<p><em>Pulmonary consumption</em> certainly prevails more on the sea-coast,
than in the interior. In all our sea-port towns, it is this
disorder which so frightfully augments the catalogue of our
bills of mortality. According to Dr. Rush, "in Salem, in the
state of Massachusetts, which is situated near the sea, and exposed,
during many months of the year, to a moist east wind,
there died in the year 1799, 160 persons; fifty-three of whom
died of the consumption."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In Philadelphia, which is more
remote from the sea, the deaths from consumption are much
less numerous than in New-York, or the other cities immediately
on the coast. In Great Britain, which is exposed to the
sea on all sides, it is calculated that about 55,000 die annually
from this disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are some of the facts on this subject; but the conclusion
does not appear to be warranted, that these pulmonary
affections arise from the irritating quality of the air. In Holland,
the West Indies, as well as in other countries and islands,
exposed to the sea air, consumption is of rare occurrence. In
Syria, Volney even states that the air of the coast is particularly
favourable to those labouring under this malady. Accordingly
they are in the habit of sending such patients from
Aleppo to Latakia, or Saide, where they may enjoy the benefit
of sea air.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Again, we know that many persons suffering from this affection,
have been completely cured by a voyage, after all the
resources of medicine had been exhausted upon them in vain.</p>

<p>It is evident then, that a <em>pure</em> sea air is not detrimental in
cases of consumption. Dr. Rush, with his usual ingenuity, explains
the prevalence of this complaint in our sea-ports, by attributing
it to the mixture of land and sea air; and in confirmation
observes, that "those situations which are in the neighbourhood
of bays and rivers, where the fresh and salt waters
mix their streams together, are more unfavourable to consumptive
patients than the seashore, and therefore should be more
carefully avoided by them in exchanging city for country air."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Independently, however, of these causes, I think the frequent
and sudden vicissitudes of temperature, which we suffer
on the coast, are alone sufficient to account for the prevalence
of catarrhal and pneumonic affections, which most commonly
are the precursors of consumption.</p>

<p>I trust the foregoing observations have not been considered
too <em>medical</em> to comport with the objects of this Society. Natural
history is only useful in its practical applications; and if
it can be shown to throw any light upon an art, which contributes
so much to the comfort and happiness of man, we have
established one of the strongest considerations, which can recommend
it to general patronage and investigation. Physicians
ought in an especial manner to set a high value upon the
researches of naturalists. The aid they have already given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>is sufficient to entitle them to the lasting gratitude of our profession.
It was one of the merits of that illustrious physician
of our own time and country, Dr. Rush, that he seized with
avidity every fact, from whatever quarter it might be drawn,
to elucidate his favourite science. If ever medicine shall attain
to the elevation of a truly <em>philosophical science</em>, it must be accomplished,
in part at least, by imitating his example, and by
developing the infinite and diversified associations which exist
between it and the other sciences.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Art. XIV.</span> &nbsp; <em>Thoughts on Atmospheric Dust. By</em> <span class="smcap">C. S.
Rafinesque</span>, <em>Esq.</em></p>


<p class="noindent">1. <span class="fs150">"</span><span class="fs200">W</span>hen we find the ruins of ancient cities buried
under ground; when the plough uncovers the front of palaces
and the summit of old temples, we are astonished: but
we seldom reflect why they are hidden in the earth. A sort
of imperceptible dust falls at all times from the atmosphere,
and it has covered them during ages."</p>

<p>2. These are the words of the worthy and eloquent philosopher
<span class="smcap">Virey</span>, in his article Nature, Vol. XV. p. 373, of the
French Dictionary of Natural History. Even before reading
them I had observed the same phenomenon, and I have since
studied their effects in various places. I could quote one
thousand instances of the extensive and multifarious operations
of this meteoric dust: but I mean to give the results merely
of those that fall daily under notice, and are yet totally neglected;
wishing to draw on them the attention of chemists,
philosophers, and geologists.</p>

<p>3. Whenever the sun shines in a dark room, its beams display
a crowd of lucid dusty molecules of various shapes,
which were before invisible as the air in which they swim,
but did exist nevertheless. These form the atmospheric
dust; existing every where in the lower strata of our atmosphere.
I have observed it on the top of the highest moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>tains,
on Mount Etna, in Sicily, on the Alps, on the Alleghany
and Catskill mountains in America, &amp;c. and on the ocean.</p>

<p>4. It deserves to be considered under many views: which
are its invisibility, its shape and size, its formation and origin,
its motion, its deposition and accumulation, its composition,
its uses, and its properties.</p>

<p>5. This dust is invisible, owing to the tenuity of its particles,
but they become visible in the following instances;
when the sun shines on them, since they reflect the light,
when their size is increased, and when they are accumulated
any where.</p>

<p>6. The size of the particles is very unequal, and their
shape dissimilar; the greatest portion are exceedingly small,
similar to a whitish or grayish spark, without any determinable
or perceptible shape; the larger particles are commonly
lamellar or flattened, but with an irregular margin, and the
largest appear to be lengthened or filiform; the gray colour
prevails. Other shapes are now and then perceptible with
the microscope.</p>

<p>7. Among the properties of atmospheric dust are those of
being soft, as light as atmospheric air, of reflecting the rays
received directly from the sun, of possessing a kind of peculiar
electricity, which gives it a tendency to accumulate on
some bodies more readily than on some others, and of forming
an earthy sediment, which does not become effervescent with
acids.</p>

<p>8. This dust is either constantly or periodically formed, but
chemically in the atmosphere like snow, hail, meteoric stones,
honey-dew, earthy rains, &amp;c. by the combination of gaseous
and elementary particles dissolved in the air. Its analysis
has never been attempted by chemists; but the earthy sediment
which is the result of its accumulated deposition, proves
that it is a compound of earthy particles in a peculiar state of
aggregation, and in which alumine appears to preponderate,
rather than calcareous or silicious earths or oxides.</p>

<p>9. Its motion in calm weather, or in a quiet room, is very
slow; the particles appear to float in the air in all directions,
some rising, some falling, and many swimming horizontally, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
forming a variety of curved lines; what is most singular, is
that no two particles appear to have exactly the same direction;
yet after awhile the greatest proportion fall down obliquely,
somewhat in the same manner as a light snow in a
calm day. When a current of air is created naturally or
artificially in the open air or in a room, you perceive at
once an increased velocity in their motion; they move with
rapidity in all directions; but when a strong current or wind
prevails, they are carried with it in a stream, preserving however,
as yet, their irregular up and down motion.</p>

<p>10. Its formation is sometimes very rapid, and its accumulation
very thick in the lower strata of our atmosphere, but
the intensity is variable. Whenever rain or snow falls, this
dust is precipitated on the ground by it, whence arises the
purity of the air after rain and snow; but a small share is still
left, or soon after formed. In common weather it deposits
itself on the ground by slow degrees, and the same in closed
rooms. It forms then the dust of our floors, the mould of our
roofs, and ultimately the surface of our soil, unless driven by
winds from one place to another.</p>

<p>11. I have measured its accumulation in a quiet room, and
have found it variable from one-fourth of an inch to one inch
in the course of one year; but it was then in a pulverulent
fleecy state, and might be reduced by compression to one-third
of its height, making the average of yearly deposit
about one-sixth of an inch. In the open air this quantity must
be still more variable, owing to the quantities carried by
the winds and waters to the plains, valleys, rivers, the sea,
&amp;c. or accumulated in closed places or against walls, houses,
&amp;c. I calculate, however, that upon an average, from six to
twelve inches are accumulated over the ground in one hundred
years, where it mixes with the soil and organic exuviæ,
to form the common mould.</p>

<p>12. The uses of this chronic meteor are many and obvious.
It serves to create mould over rocks, to increase their decomposition,
to add to our cultivable soil, to amalgamate the
alluvial and organic deposits, to fertilize sandy and unfruitful
tracts in the course of time, to administer to vegetable life, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
It does not appear that it has any bad influence on men and
animals breathing it along with air, unless it should be accumulated
in a very intense degree.</p>

<p>13. At Segesta, in Sicily, are to be seen the ruins of an
ancient temple; the steps, which surround it on all sides below
the pillars, are built on a rock, on the top of a hill
detached from any other higher ground. Yet now all the
steps and the base of the pillars are under the ground, which
has accumulated from this dust and the decay of plants (not
trees) to which it has afforded food. There are from five to
eight feet from the rock to the surface of this new soil, which
has chemically combined in a variety of hardness. This soil
has arisen there in about 2000 years, notwithstanding the
washings of rain. I quote this as a remarkable instance of
the increase of soil by aerial deposits, among many which
have fallen under my personal examination.</p>

<p>14. It is commonly believed that the dust of our rooms is
produced by the fragments of decomposed vestments, beddings,
furnitures, &amp;c.; this cause increases it, and produces a
different dust, which mixes with the atmospheric dust; but it
is very far from producing it.</p>

<p>15. The dust of the open air is ascribed to that raised from
roads and fields, by the pulverization of their surface; but
this secondary and visible dust is only a consequence of the
first. From whence could arise the dust observed by the
means of the sunbeams in a dark corner, in winter, when the
ground is frozen, or when it is wet and muddy, or at sea, or
on the top of rocky mountains?</p>

<p>16. It is therefore a matter of fact, worth taking into consideration
by geologists, that the air still deposits a quantity
of dust, which must have been much greater in former periods.
Just the same as the sea deposits still a quantity of
earthy and saline particles dissolved in it, and which were
superabundant at the period when the rocky strata were
formed on its bottom. Water being more compact, deposits
rocks. Air, which is less dense, deposits a pulverulent
matter!</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. XV. On the Effect of Vapour on Flame.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Art. XV.</span> &nbsp; <em>On the Effect of Vapour on Flame. By</em> <span class="smcap">J. F.
Dana</span>, <em>Chemical Assistant in Harvard University, and
Lecturer on Chemistry and Pharmacy in Dartmouth College</em>.</p></div>

<p class="p1 center"><em>To Professor Silliman.</em></p>

<p><span class="pad1 fs70">DEAR SIR,</span><br />


<span class="fs200">A</span>bout a year since I made some experiments on the effect
of steam on ignited bodies, with a view to learn the theory of
the action of the "American water-burner." These experiments
were published in an anonymous paper in the North
American Review, and have been published in London, without
an acknowledgment of their source.</p>

<p>The effect of them concerning bodies is peculiar, and it
probably admits of more extensive application to the arts than
in the above named instrument alone.</p>

<p>When a jet of steam, issuing from a small aperture, is
thrown on burning charcoal, the brightness is increased, if the
coal be held at the distance of four or five inches from the
pipe through which the steam passes; but if the coal be held
nearer it is extinguished, a circular black spot first appears
where the steam is thrown on it. The steam in this case does
not appear to be decomposed, and the increased brightness of
the coal depends probably on a current of atmospheric air,
occasioned by the steam. But when a jet of steam, instead of
being thrown on a single coal, is made to pass into a charcoal
fire, the vividness of the combustion is increased, and the low
attenuated flame of coal is enlarged.</p>

<p>When the wick of a common oil lamp is raised, so as to
give off large columns of smoke, and a jet of steam is thrown
into it, the brightness of the flame is increased, and no smoke
is thrown off.</p>

<p>When spirits of turpentine is made to burn on a wick, the
light produced is dull and reddish, and a large quantity of thick
smoke is given off; but when a jet of steam is thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
this flame, its brightness is much increased; and when the
experiment is carefully performed, the smoke entirely disappears.</p>

<p>When the vapour of spirits of turpentine is made to issue
from a small orifice, and inflamed, it burns, and throws off
large quantities of smoke; but when a jet of steam is made to
unite with the vapour, the smoke entirely disappears. When
vapour of spirits of turpentine and of water are made to issue
together from the same orifice, and inflamed, no smoke appears.
Hence its disappearing, in the above experiment,
cannot be supposed to depend on a current of atmospheric air.</p>

<p>When a jet of steam is thrown into the flame of a spirit of
wine lamp, or into flames which evolve no smoke or carbonaceous
matter, the same effect is produced as by a current of
air.</p>

<p>It appears, from these experiments, that in all flames which
evolve smoke, steam produces an increased brightness, and a
more perfect combustion.</p>

<p>Now, with a very simple apparatus, steam might be introduced
into the flames of street lamps, and that kind of lamp
which is used in butchers' shops in London, and in all flames
which evolve much smoke. The advantage of such an arrangement
would be a more perfect combustion, and a greater
quantity of light from the same materials. The flame of the
lamps, to which steam is applied, might be made to keep the
water boiling which supplies the steam.</p>

<p>I hope the above may not be altogether uninteresting and
useless to the readers of your Journal.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">Art. XVI. Analysis of the Harrodsburg Salts.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Art. XVI.</span> &nbsp; <em>Analysis of the Harrodsburg Salts, by</em> <span class="smcap">Edward
D. Smith</span>, M. D. <em>Professor of Chemistry and
Mineralogy in the South-Carolina College</em>.</p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">M</span>ore than a year since I received a quantity of a white
earthy substance, which was said to be obtained by the evaporation
of certain mineral waters at Harrodsburg, Kentucky,
and there vended at a considerable price, under the name of
Epsom salts. The respectable character who presented this
powder to me, requested that I would make an analysis of it;
but I had not sufficient leisure until lately, to pay the requisite
attention to this subject. The results of my examinations are
now submitted to the public eye.</p>

<p>The external qualities of this substance are as follow: small
white lumps, hard to the touch, but dry and easily yielding to
pressure, somewhat gritty to the teeth, and imparting an earthy
and saline taste to the tongue.</p>

<p>1. 120 grains of the powder were put into about a half ounce
of alcohol, digested for six hours, then, washed with more alcohol,
filtered and carefully dried.</p>

<p>2. On weighing the dry powder, the loss appeared to be but
one grain, so that it contains very little of any substance which
is soluble in alcohol.</p>

<p>3. 115 grains (four grains having been lost in the transfer
from the filter) were collected and put into rather more than
eight times their weight of cold distilled water, and digested
for two hours.</p>

<p>4. This watery solution was then filtered, and on weighing,
the residue appeared to be 48 grains, so that 67 grains must
have been dissolved.</p>

<p>5. 10 grains of the insoluble residue (4) were put into a
flask, with 10 ounces of distilled water, and boiled for 1 hour.</p>

<p>6. A small portion of this solution, on being tested with nitrate
of barytes, gave a copious white precipitate, with oxalic
acid, a white cloud; with ammonia, a slight white cloud; with
muriatic acid, a slight bluish tinge. From these tests it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
inferred that sulphate of lime was present, with perhaps a
slight trace of muriate of lime.</p>

<p>7. The remainder of this solution was filtered, and on
weighing the dried residuum, the loss appeared to be 2 grains,
so that sulphate of lime probably constitutes nearly ⅕ of the
insoluble residence (48 grains. 4.)</p>

<p>8. The watery solution, (4) which was supposed to contain
67 grains, was evaporated, and left a residue that weighed but
34 grains, so that 33 grains must have disappeared in the
process.</p>

<p>9. Some of this residue dissolved in distilled water, was
tested with carbonate of soda, forming an immediate white
cloud; with nitrate of barytes, the same; with ammonia, the
same; but with oxalate of ammonia, it did not form any cloud
until it had stood some time, and then it was slight. From these
tests it was inferred that sulphate of magnesia was present.</p>

<p>10. A portion of the dried residuum (7) was treated with
diluted muriatic acid, which dissolved nearly the whole of it,
with considerable effervescence. The new compound, on
examination, proved to be muriate of lime; so that it may be
concluded the residuum (7) was principally carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>On considering the results of the preceding experiments, it
will appear that more than one half of the substances submitted
to analysis, was easily soluble in water, and from the
chemical tests used, that it was composed principally of sulphate
of magnesia, (Epsom salt) with perhaps a small portion of muriate
of lime or magnesia, that of the remainder, about ⅕ was
sulphate of lime, and difficultly soluble in water; and that the
rest was perfectly insoluble in water, and consisted principally
of carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt then, that the Harrodsburg salt, in
its present state, is very improperly prepared, containing in its
composition a large proportion of matter, that is not only inert,
but which may produce considerable inconvenience and injury
in the stomach and bowels, from its ponderous nature and tendency
to form mechanical obstructions. Perhaps the occurrence
of such injury may not be frequent, from the circumstance
of a large portion of the salt being so insoluble; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
admitting this to be the fact, there is a manifest impropriety in
offering to the public, as medicine, an article which cannot be
used as such. Probably the proprietors of this manufactory
are not aware of the real nature of the case, and of the facility
with which, by a little additional trouble, they could separate
the useful and valuable material, from that which is at least
useless, and which might also be pernicious.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Art. XVII.</span> &nbsp; <em>Additional Notice of the Tungsten and Tellurium,
mentioned in our last Number.</em></p></div>


<p class="p1 pfs90"><span class="smcap">Part I.</span> <em>Description of the Ore.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">C</span>olour, dark brown, almost black; brittle, powder a
lighter shade of brown than the mineral; hard, scratches glass,
scintillates with steel, with a red spark; a degree of polish
produced, where the steel strikes, and when the steel is impressed
upon it.</p>

<p>Structure compact, in some places slightly porous; lustre,
generally dull, sometimes glimmering, and almost resinous.</p>

<p>Crystals octahedral. Specific gravity of three massive
pieces, 5.7, 6. and 6.44 mean, 6.05 nearly; probably that of
the crystals would be higher.</p>

<p>Infusible by the blow-pipe even with borax, and does not
by strong ignition impart any colour to it or to potash; not
magnetic, even in fine powder, nor after being heated red hot
on charcoal, and in contact with burning grease.</p>

<p>Many specimens decrepitate violently under the blow-pipe.
When heated on coals in pieces of considerable size, they often
explode with a smart report, and are thrown in fragments
sometimes several yards from the fire.</p>

<p>Gangue quartz; accompanying minerals in the same vein,
native bismuth, native silver, galena, iron and copper pyrites,
much magnetic pyrites, blende, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Geological relations.</em> The country is primitive, and the immediate
rock which forms the walls of the vein is said to be
gneiss; (we have not seen it.)</p>

<p>Locality, town of Huntington, parish of New Stratford,
county of Fairfield, 20 miles west from New-Haven, Connecticut.</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em> Native bismuth in small quantities, has been for
several years obtained from this mine, but the shaft has been
sunk only about ten feet.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">Part II.</span> <em>A variety of the Ore.</em></p>

<p>General characters as above, but on some parts, there is
seen a whitish, or yellowish, or sometimes darkish metallic
substance; it is in thin plates, like the leaf metals, and sometimes
reticulated, and graphic in its disposition; it is soft and
easily cut with the knife. In the specimens examined, it was
so much blended with the other ore, and so trifling in quantity,
that it was not possible to separate it mechanically, so as to
examine it separately.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">Part III.&mdash;A.</span> <em>Chemical Trials.</em></p>

<p>1. Muriatic acid, hot or cold, produces no effect; hot nitro-muriatic
dissolves the ore with energy, red fumes are evolved,
and generally a red solution obtained, from which ammonia
precipitates red oxyd of iron abundantly.</p>

<p>2. A heavy lemon-yellow powder remains, insoluble of
course in acids, but easily and completely soluble in warm
ammonia.</p>

<p>3. A dark powder, in diminished quantity, again appears,
more acid dissolves it in part, and again reveals the yellow
powder, which ammonia again dissolves, and so on, till nothing
remains but some portion of the gangue.</p>

<p>4. The ammoniacal solution, which contains the oxyd of
tungsten, is decomposed by acids, and by heat, and instantly
deposits a white heavy powder, becoming yellowish by standing,
and full yellow by heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>5. This powder is infusible by the blow-pipe, but ignited
with borax in a platinum crucible, it became of a superb blue,
like smalt, or between that and Prussian blue.</p>

<p>6. The quantity obtained was too small to make it convenient
to attempt its reduction to the metallic state; no doubt
remained, however, that it was oxyd of tungsten, or as it is
sometimes called, tungstic acid.</p>

<p>7. There were traces of manganese, and all the facts perhaps
justify the conclusion, that the ore is very similar to the
ferruginous tungsten or wolfram.</p>

<p>8. The calcareous tungsten occurs in octahedral crystals,
but we have not before heard of this form in the ferruginous
species, which generally affects the prismatic forms.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">B. remark.</span></p>

<p>We had been for some time inclined to believe, that the
above ore was ferruginous tungsten, but although fortified by
the opinion of Col. Gibbs, we were withheld from announcing
it, because the form of the crystals, the specific gravity, the
colour, and perhaps some other characters, were not perfectly
accordant with European descriptions, and with the specimens
in our possession, which are from Saxony and Cornwall.</p>

<p>During the necessary chemical trials (which have, we trust,
established the correctness of the above opinion,) we very
unexpectedly discovered in some of the ores of tungsten, proofs
of the existence of tellurium. The conclusion was induced
by the phenomena, for nothing was farther from our expectations.</p>

<p>Two fragments were pulverized <em>by an assistant</em>, and we
therefore cannot say whether they had any external characters
different from those of the other pieces; they came, however,
from the same part of the vein, and their powder resembled
that of the other pieces.</p>

<p>1. Digested in nitro-muriatic acid, a straw-yellow solution,
slightly inclining to green, was obtained, and a black powder
was left behind.</p>

<p>2. More acid digested on this powder, gave a deep red solution
of iron, and left the yellow oxyd of tungsten, which being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
dissolved in ammonia, the black powder again appeared, and
so on, as under 3. Part III.</p>

<p>3. The solution 1, diluted largely with water, deposited an
abundant white precipitate, which was very heavy and rapidly
subsided.</p>

<p>4. Alcohol and ammonia, respectively produced the same
effect, only more decidedly.</p>

<p>5. This precipitate, evidently an oxyd of a metal, being collected
on a filter and dried, exhibited the following properties.</p>

<p>6. Heated by the blow-pipe on charcoal, it was instantly volatilized
in part, and in part decomposed, with an almost explosive
effervescence; numerous ignited globules of metal
appeared on the charcoal, and burned with an abundant flame
of a delicate blue colour, edged occasionally with green.</p>

<p>7. In many trials, these results always occurred, and sometimes
a peculiar odour was perceived, at first thought to be
owing to arsenic, but it was incomparably feebler, and somewhat
resembled that of radishes.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>8. Zinc, iron, and tin, plunged into separate portions of the
nitro-muriatic solution, precipitated abundantly a black flocculent
substance.</p>

<p>9. On charcoal before the blow-pipe, this substance was
very combustible, with a blue flame, and was completely dissipated
in the form of white oxyd, with the above smell.</p>

<p>10. Some of it was obtained on the charcoal in metallic
globules; it was a brittle metal, white, with a tinge of red, and
foliated, but not so distinctly as bismuth and antimony.</p>

<p>11. The filters on which the white oxyd had been deposited,
burned almost with explosion, nearly as rapidly as if they had
been soaked with nitrate of potash, or of ammonia, and the
characteristic blue flame appeared while the burning lasted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>
<p>12. Other experiments were made upon the metal, (not the
oxyd.) It gave to strong sulphuric acid, (simply by standing
in it in the cold) an amethystine colour, which disappeared as
the acid grew weaker, by attracting water from the air.</p>

<p>13. With nitric acid it formed a colourless solution, not decomposed
by water.</p>

<p>14. It did not dissolve in muriatic acid, till a few drops of
nitric acid were added.</p>

<p>15. The white oxyd heated with charcoal in a small coated
recurved glass tube, afforded brilliant metallic globules, which
rose by distillation, collected in the bend of the tube, and resembled
drops of quicksilver, except that they were solid.</p>


<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">C. remark.</span></p>

<p>The above facts having induced the conclusion that the
metal, thus unexpectedly discovered in the ores of tungsten,
was tellurium,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> we were led to search for external characters
by which to judge what specimens contained it. The ores
from Transylvania, (the only telluric ores with which we are
acquainted,) bearing no analogy in appearance or composition
to those before us, we were led to inquire whether the tellurium
in these latter ores was <em>in combination</em> with tungsten, or
merely <em>in mixture</em>. The external characters detailed in part
II, tend perhaps to fortify the latter opinion. If we mistake
not, we there found a proper ore of tellurium mixed with a
proper ore of tungsten, but we have also by chemical means,
found tellurium where similar external characters were not
apparent. Before the appearance of our next Number, we
hope to obtain purer and better specimens. In the mean time
we add the following facts.</p>

<p>1. A crystal, and a massive piece of the kind described
under part I, and specimens of two varieties of those described
under part II, were digested in nitro-muriatic acid.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>
<p>2. Both oxyd of tungsten, and oxyd of tellurium were obtained
from all of them.</p>

<p>3. Many specimens have been examined which have afforded
tungsten only, and no tellurium.</p>


<p class="p1" />
<p>At a convenient time, it is hoped that a more complete examination
of this subject may be presented to the public.</p>

<p>In the mean time, we may submit to mineralogists and chemists,
whether if this is not a new mineral, it is not at least a
new association of two minerals before known. It has not
been forgotten that gold and silver are frequently combined
with tellurium: neither of them has, however, been discovered,
(although sought after by proper tests) during the above
trials.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">F</span>ew subjects have more occupied the attention of chemists,
than the means of impregnating fluids with gaseous substances.
The contrivances of Woulfe and Nooth, especially the former,
have been almost universally used; and have gained for the
inventors merited celebrity. Various improvements in
Woulfe's bottles have been devised. Still I believe an apparatus
replete with similar advantages, but less unwieldy, less
liable to fracture; and having fewer junctures to make at each
operation, has been a great desideratum with every practical
chemist. It has, however, ceased to be so with me, since I
contrived the apparatus which I am about to describe.</p>

<p>Fig. 1. represents 3 jars placed concentrically within each
other, and so proportioned and situated, as to admit 2 open-necked
concentric bell glasses alternately between them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
neck of the exterior bell glass is introduced into the tubulure
of the receiver above, and receives the neck of the interior
bell glass. Into this is inserted a trumpet-shaped tube. The
two interior jars are furnished with feet F, <em>f</em>. In order to put
this apparatus into operation, remove (without taking them
apart) the bell glasses, receiver, and tube from the jars. Pour
into the latter the fluid, to be impregnated, till it reaches the
height marked by the dots. The funnel mouth, <em>m</em>, of the receiver
being provided with a suitable cork soaked in wax, fasten
into it firmly the beak of the retort, containing the generating
materials. The bell glasses are then to be replaced in
the jars, and arranged as in the figure. It must be self-evident
that the gas proceeding from the retort, (if the juncture at <em>m</em>
be air tight) must press on the fluid in the innermost jar,
through the trumpet-shaped tube. If not imbibed with adequate
speed, it must soon press on the fluid at <em>a</em>, causing it to
subside to the narrow part of the foot <em>f</em>, and thus to expose a
much larger surface. If the absorption be still inadequate, a
further subsidence must ensue, and the gas escaping round the
brim of the interior bell glass will act on the fluid at <em>b</em>, and enlarge
its surface by depressing it to the narrow part of the
foot F. Should the increased pressure and more extended
contact thus obtained, be still incompetent to effect a complete
absorption, the excess of the gas may escape round the brim
of the external bell glass into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>But so effectual is this process in promoting impregnation,
that I have obtained strong muriatic acid in the central jar,
without producing any sensible acidity in the outside one.
Absorption into the retort or receiver, is prevented by not allowing
as much fluid to be above the mouth of the trumpet-shaped
tube, as would be competent to fill the cavity between
it, and the termination of the open neck of the exterior bell
glass at <em>t</em>. As this neck rises about 2 or 3 inches into the receiver,
it prevents any foul matter which may condense or boil
over, from getting into the jars. If practicable, it would be
better that the bell glasses, and tube, and receiver, should be
united together while hot, at the glass-house. If all could not
be joined in this way, it would still be advantageous to unite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>thus the receiver, and the exterior bell glass. The interior
bell and tube might then be fastened together, by grinding or
luting. As yet I have only used lutings of waxed cloth, or
cork. It may be proper to point out, that 3 or more concentric
bell glasses, and 4 or more jars, might be used. The
union of the bells, receiver, and tube once effected, it is hardly
more troublesome to use 3 than 2. When the fluid in the
central jar is saturated, this may be emptied and replenished
from the middle jar, the latter from the external one. Then
supplying the external jar anew, the process may be continued.</p>

<p>The other figures are to explain an apparatus on the same
principle, constructed of hollow, oblong paralellopipeds, differing
in length more than in breadth; so as to allow a serpentine
tube to wind into the interior, and deliver gas under
a vessel shaped like a T.</p>

<p>It may be well to mention, that this apparatus, from the facility

admits of being made of porcelain or stone ware.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> I have had
a cylindrical one constructed of the latter material, in which
the covers are in one piece, with a tube in the centre for introducing
gas. The apparatus may be made more efficacious,
by drilling a series of small holes round the brims of the bell
glasses or covers, so as to cause the gas, instead of passing
round the brims in large bubbles, to divide itself into very
small ones. By this means it will be more thoroughly intermingled
with fluid.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs70">(With an Engraving.)</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span> have for some time been of opinion that the principle
extricated by the Voltaic pile is a compound of caloric and
electricity, both being original and collateral products of
Galvanic action.</p>

<p>The grounds of this conviction and some recent experiments
confirming it, are stated in the following paper.</p>

<p>It is well known that heat is liberated by the Voltaic apparatus,
in a manner and degree which has not been imitated by
means of mechanical electricity; and that the latter, while it
strikes at a greater distance, and pervades conductors with
much greater speed, can with difficulty be made to effect the
slightest decompositions. Wollaston, it is true, decomposed
water by means of it; but the experiment was performed of
necessity on a scale too minute to permit of his ascertaining,
whether there were any divellent polar attractions exercised
towards the atoms, as in the case of the pile. The result was
probably caused by mechanical concussion, or that process by
which the particles of matter are dispersed when a battery is
discharged through them. The opinion of Dr. Thomson,
that the fluid of the pile is in quantity greater, in intensity
less, than that evolved by the machine, is very inconsistent
with the experiments of the chemist above mentioned, who,
before he could effect the separation of the elements of water
by mechanical electricity, was obliged to confine its emission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>to a point imperceptible to the naked eye. If already so
highly intense, wherefore the necessity of a further concentration?
Besides, were the distinction made by Dr. Thomson
correct, the more concentrated fluid generated by a galvanic
apparatus of a great many small pairs, ought most to resemble
that of the ordinary electricity; but the opposite is the case.
The ignition produced by a few large Galvanic plates, where
the intensity is of course low, is a result most analogous to the
chemical effects of a common electrical battery. According
to my view, caloric and electricity may be distinguished by
the following characteristics. The former permeates all
matter more or less, though with very different degrees of
facility. It radiates through air, with immeasurable celerity,
and distributing itself in the interior of bodies, communicates
a reciprocally repellent power to atoms, but not to masses.
Electricity does not radiate in or through any matter; and
while it pervades some bodies, as metals, with almost infinite
velocity; by others, it is so far from being conducted, that it
can only pass through them by a fracture or perforation.
Distributing itself over surfaces only, it causes repulsion between
masses, but not between the particles of the same
mass. The disposition of the last-mentioned principle to get
off by neighbouring conductors, and of the other to combine
with the adjoining matter, or to escape by radiation, would
prevent them from being collected at the positive pole, if not
in combination with each other. Were it not for a modification
of their properties, consequent to some such union, they
could not, in piles of thousands of pairs, be carried forward
through the open air and moisture; the one so well calculated
to conduct away electricity, the other so favourable to the
radiation of caloric.</p>

<p>Pure electricity does not expand the slips of gold-leaf, between
which it causes repulsion, nor does caloric cause any
repulsion in the ignited masses which it expands. But as the
compound fluid extricated by Galvanic action, which I shall
call electro-caloric, distributes itself through the interior of
bodies, and is evidently productive of corpuscular repulsion,
it is in this respect more allied to caloric than to electricity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, that when common electricity causes the deflagration
of metals, as by the discharge of a Leyden jar, it must be
supposed to insinuate itself within them, and cause a reaction
between their particles. But in this case, agreeably to my
hypothesis, the electric fluid combines with the latent caloric
previously existing there, and, adding to its repulsive agency,
causes it to overpower cohesion.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy was so much at a loss to account for the
continued ignition of wire at the poles of a Voltaic apparatus,
that he considers it an objection to the materiality of heat;
since the wire could not be imagined to contain sufficient
caloric to keep up the emission of this principle for an unlimited
time. But if we conceive an accumulation of heat to
accompany that of electricity throughout the series, and to be
propagated from one end to the other, the explanation of the
phenomenon in question is attended by no difficulty.</p>

<p>The effect of the Galvanic fluid on charcoal is very consistent
with my views, since, next to metals, it is one of the best
conductors of electricity, and the worst of heat, and would
therefore arrest the last, and allow the other to pass on.
Though peculiarly liable to intense ignition, when exposed
between the poles of the Voltaic apparatus, it seems to me it
does not display this characteristic with common electricity.
According to Sir Humphry Davy, when in connexion with the
positive pole, and communicating by a platina wire with the
negative pole, the latter is less heated than when, with respect
to the poles, the situation of the wire and charcoal is
reversed. The rationale is obvious: charcoal, being a bad
conductor, and a good radiator, prevents the greater part of
the heat from reaching the platina, when placed between it
and the source whence the heat flows.</p>

<p>I had observed that as the number of pairs in Volta's pile
had been extended, and their size and the energy of the interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
agents lessened, the ratio of the electrical effects to
those of heat had increased; till in De Luc's column they had
become completely predominant; and, on the other hand,
when the pairs were made larger and fewer (as in Children's
apparatus) the calorific influence had gained the ascendancy.
I was led to go farther in this way, and to examine whether
one pair of plates of enormous size, or what might be equivalent
thereto, would not exhibit heat more purely, and demonstrate
it, equally with the electric fluid, a primary product of
Galvanic combinations. The elementary battery of Wollaston,
though productive of an evanescent ignition, was too minute
to allow him to make the observations which I had in
view.</p>

<p>Twenty copper and twenty zinc plates, about nineteen
inches square, were supported vertically in a frame, the different
metals alternating at one half inch distance from each
other. All the plates of the same kind of metal were soldered
to a common slip, so that each set of homogeneous plates
formed one continuous metallic superficies. When the copper
and zinc surfaces, thus formed, are united by an intervening
wire, and the whole immerged in an acid, or aceto-saline
solution, in a vessel devoid of partitions, the wire becomes
intensely ignited; and when hydrogen is liberated it
usually takes fire, producing a very beautiful undulating, or
coruscating flame.</p>

<p>I am confident, that if Volta and the other investigators of
Galvanism, instead of multiplying the pairs of Galvanic plates,
had sought to increase the effect by enlarging one pair as I
have done, (for I consider the copper and zinc surfaces as
reduced to two by the connexion) the apparatus would have
been considered as presenting a new mode of evolving heat, as
a primary effect independently of electrical influence. There
is no other indication of electricity when wires from the two
surfaces touch the tongue, than a slight taste, such as is excited
by small pieces of zinc and silver laid on it and under it,
and brought into contact with each other.</p>

<p>It was with a view of examining the effects of the proximity
and alternation in the heterogeneous plates that I had them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
cut into separate squares. By having them thus divided, I
have been enabled to ascertain that when all of one kind of
metal are ranged on one side of the frame, and all of the other
kind on the other side of it, the effect is no greater than might
be expected from one pair of plates.</p>

<p>Volta, considering the changes consequent to his contrivance
as the effect of a movement in the electric fluid, called
the process electro-motion, and the plates producing it electro-motors.
But the phenomena show that the plates, as I
have arranged them, are calori-motors, or heat movers,
and the effect calori-motion. That this is a new view of
the subject, may be inferred from the following passage in
Davy's Elements. That great chemist observes, "When
very small conducting surfaces are used for conveying very
large quantities of electricity, they become ignited; and of the
different conductors that have been compared, charcoal is
most easily heated by electrical discharges,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> next iron, platina,
gold, then copper, and lastly, zinc. The phenomena of electrical
ignition, whether taking place in gaseous, fluid, or solid
bodies, always seem to be the result of a violent exertion of
the electrical attractive and repellent powers, which may be
connected with motions of the particles of the substances
affected. That no subtile fluid, such as the matter of heat
has been imagined to be, can be discharged from these substances,
in consequence of the effect of the electricity, seems
probable, from the circumstance, that a wire of platina may
be preserved in a state of intense ignition in vacuo, by means
of the Voltaic apparatus, for an unlimited time; and such a
wire cannot be supposed to contain an inexhaustible quantity
of subtile matter."</p>

<p>But I demand where are the repellent and attractive powers
to which the ignition produced by the Calorimotor can be attributed?
Besides, I would beg leave respectfully to inquire
of this illustrious author, whence the necessity of considering
the heat evolved under the circumstances alluded to as the
effect of the electrical fluid; or why we may not as well suppose
the latter to be excited by the heat? It is evident, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
observes, that a wire cannot be supposed to contain an inexhaustible
supply of matter however subtile; but wherefore
may not one kind of subtile matter be supplied to it from the
apparatus as well as another; especially, when to suppose
such a supply is quite as inconsistent with the characteristics
of pure electricity, as with those of pure caloric?</p>

<p>It is evident from Mr. Children's paper in the Annals of
Philosophy, on the subject of his large apparatus, that the
ignition produced by it was ascribed to electrical excitement.</p>

<p>For the purpose of ascertaining the necessity of the alternation
and proximity of the copper and zinc plates, it has
been mentioned that distinct square sheets were employed.
The experiments have since been repeated and found to succeed
by Dr. Patterson and Mr. Lukens, by means of two continuous
sheets, one of zinc, the other of copper, wound into
two concentric coils or spirals. This, though the circumstance
was not known to them, was the form I had myself
proposed to adopt, and had suggested as convenient for a Galvanic
apparatus to several friends at the beginning of the winter;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
though the consideration above stated induced me to
prefer for a first experiment a more manageable arrangement.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I find that when, in the apparatus
of twenty copper and twenty zinc plates, ten copper plates on
one side are connected with ten zinc on the other, and a
communication made between the remaining twenty by a piece
of iron wire, about the eighth of an inch in diameter, the wire
enters into a vivid state of combustion on the immersion of
the plates. Platina wire equal to No. 18 (the largest I had at
hand) is rapidly fused if substituted for the iron.</p>

<p>This arrangement is equivalent to a battery of two large
Galvanic pairs; excepting that there is no insulation, all the
plates being plunged in one vessel. I have usually separated
the pairs by a board, extending across the frame merely.</p>

<p>Indeed, when the forty plates were successively associated
in pairs, of copper and zinc, though suspended in a fluid held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
in a common recipient without partitions; there was considerable
intensity of Galvanic action. This shows that, independently
of any power of conducting electricity, there is some
movement in the solvent fluid which tends to carry forward
the Galvanic principle from the copper to the zinc end of the
series. I infer that electro-caloric is communicated in this
case by circulation, and that in non-elastic fluids the same difficulty
exists as to its retrocession from the positive to the negative
end of the series, as is found in the downward passage
of caloric through them.</p>

<p>It ought to be mentioned, that the connecting wire should be
placed between the heterogeneous surfaces before their immersion,
as the most intense ignition takes place immediately
afterward. If the connexion be made after the plates are
immersed, the effect is much less powerful; and sometimes
after two or three immersions the apparatus loses its power,
though the action of the solvent should become in the interim
much more violent. Without any change in the latter, after
the plates have been for some time suspended in the air, they
regain their efficacy. I had observed in a Galvanic pile of
three hundred pairs of two inches square, a like consequence
resulting from a simultaneous immersion of the whole.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The
bars holding the plates were balanced by weights, as window-sashes
are, so that all the plates could be very quickly dipped.
A platina wire, No. 18, was fused into a globule, while the
evolution of potassium was demonstrated by a rose-coloured
flame arising from some potash which had been placed between
the poles. The heat however diminished in a few
seconds, though the greater extrication of hydrogen from the
plates indicated a more intense chemical action.</p>

<p>Agreeably to an observation of Dr. Patterson, electrical excitement
may be detected in the apparatus by the condensing
electroscope; but this is no more than what Volta observed to
be the consequence of the contact of heterogeneous metals.</p>

<p>The thinnest piece of charcoal intercepts the calorific agent,
whatever it may be. In order to ascertain this, the inside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
a hollow brass cylinder, having the internal diameter two
inches, and the outside of another smaller cylinder of the same
substance, were made conical and correspondent, so that the
greater would contain the less, and leave an interstice of about
one-sixteenth of an inch between them. This interstice was
filled with wood, by plugging the larger cylinder with this material,
and excavating the plug till it would permit the smaller
brass cylinder to be driven in. The excavation and the fitting
of the cylinders was performed accurately by means of a turning
lathe. The wood in the interstice was then charred by exposing
the whole covered by sand in a crucible to a red heat.
The charcoal, notwithstanding the shrinkage consequent to the
fire, was brought into complete contact with the inclosing metallic
surfaces by pressing the interior cylinder further into the
exterior one.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, the interior cylinder being made to touch
one of the Galvanic surfaces, a wire brought from the other
Galvanic surface into contact with the outside cylinder, was
not affected in the least, though the slightest touch of the
interior one caused ignition. The contact of the charcoal with
the containing metals probably took place throughout a superficies
of four square inches, and the wire was not much more
than the hundredth part of an inch thick, so that unless it were
to conduct electricity about forty thousand times better than
the charcoal, it ought to have been heated; if the calorific
influence of this apparatus result from electrical excitement.</p>

<p>I am led finally to suppose, that the contact of dissimilar
metals, when subjected to the action of solvents, causes a
movement in caloric as well as in the electric fluid, and that
the phenomena of Galvanism, the unlimited evolution of heat
by friction, the extrication of gaseous matter without the production
of cold, might all be explained by supposing a combination
between the fluids of heat and electricity. We find
scarcely any two kinds of ponderable matter which do not exercise
more or less affinity towards each other. Moreover,
imponderable particles are supposed highly attractive of ponderable
ones. Why then should we not infer the existence of
similar affinities between imponderable particles reciprocally?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
That a peculiar combination between heat and light exists in
the solar beams, is evident from their not imparting warmth to
a lens through which they may pass, as do those of our culinary
fires.</p>

<p>Under this view of the case, the action of the poles in Galvanic
decomposition is one of complex affinity. The particles
of compounds are attracted to the different wires agreeably to
their susceptibilities to the positive and negative attraction, and
the caloric leaving the electric fluid with which it had been
combined, unites with them at the moment that their electric
state is neutralized.</p>

<p>As an exciting fluid, I have usually employed a solution of
one part sulphuric acid, and two parts muriate of soda with
seventy of water; but, to my surprise, I have produced nearly
a white heat by an alkaline solution barely sensible to the taste.</p>

<p>For the display of the heat effects, the addition of manganese,
red lead, or the nitrates, is advantageous.</p>

<p>The rationale is obvious. The oxygen of these substances
prevents the liberation of the gaseous hydrogen, which would
carry off the caloric. Adding to diluted muriatic acid, while
acting on zinc, enough red lead to prevent effervescence, the
temperature rose from 70 to 110 Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The power of the calorimotor is much increased by having
the communication between the different sheets formed by
very large strips or masses of metal. Observing this, I rendered
the sheets of copper shorter by half an inch, for a
distance of four inches of their edges, where the communication
was to be made between the zinc sheets; and, vice versa,
the zinc was made in the same way shorter than the copper
sheets where these were to communicate with each other.
The edges of the shortened sheets being defended by strips of
wood, tin was cast on the intermediate protruding edges of the
longer ones, so as to embrace a portion of each equal to about
one quarter of an inch by four inches. On one side, the tin
was made to run completely across, connecting at the same
time ten copper and ten zinc sheets. On the other side there
was an interstice of above a quarter of an inch left between
the stratum of tin embracing the copper, and that embracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the zinc plates. On each of the approaching terminations of
the connecting tin strata was soldered a kind of forceps,
formed of a bent piece of sheet brass, furnished with a screw
for pressing the jaws together. The distance between the
different forceps was about two inches. The advantage of a
very close contact was made very evident by the action of the
screws; the relaxation or increase of pressure on the connecting
wire by turning them being productive of a correspondent
change in the intensity of ignition.</p>

<p>It now remains to state, that by means of iron ignited in
this apparatus, a fixed alkali may be decomposed extemporaneously.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
If a connecting iron wire, while in combustion,
be touched by the hydrate of potash, the evolution of potassium
is demonstrated by a rose-coloured flame. The alkali
may be applied to the wire in small pieces in a flat hook of
sheet iron. But the best mode of application is by means of a
tray made by doubling a slip of sheet iron at the ends, and
leaving a receptacle in the centre, in which the potash may
be placed covered with filings. This tray being substituted
for the connecting wire, as soon as the immersion of the
apparatus causes the metal to burn, the rose-coloured flame
appears, and if the residuum left in the sheet iron be afterward
thrown into water, an effervescence sometimes ensues.</p>

<p>I have ascertained that an iron heated to combustion, by a
blacksmith's forge fire, will cause the decomposition of the
hydrate of potash.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the Calorimotor may be much reduced
without proportionably diminishing the effect. I have one of
sixty plates within a cubic foot, which burns off No. 16, iron
wire. A good workman could get 120 plates of a foot square
within a hollow cube of a size no larger. But the inflammation
of the hydrogen which gives so much splendour to the
experiment, can only be exhibited advantageously on a large
scale.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs70">EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE.</p>

<p>A <em>a</em>, Fig. 1st, two cubical vessels, 20 inches square, inside.
<em>b b b b</em> a frame of wood containing 20 sheets of copper, and
20 sheets of zinc, alternating with each other, and about half
an inch apart. T T <em>t t</em> masses of tin cast over the protruding
edges of the sheets which are to communicate with each other.
Fig. 2, represents the mode in which the junction between
the various sheets and tin masses is effected. Between the
letters <em>z z</em>, the zinc only is in contact with the tin masses.
Between <em>c c</em> the copper alone touches. It may be observed,
that, at the back of the frame, ten sheets of copper between
<em>c c</em>, and ten sheets of zinc between <em>z z</em>, are made to communicate,
by a common mass of tin extending the whole length of
the frame, between T T: but in front, as in fig. 1, there is an
interstice between the mass of tin connecting the ten copper
sheets, and that connecting the ten zinc sheets. The screw
forceps, appertaining to each of the tin masses, may be seen
on either side of the interstice: and likewise a wire for
ignition held between them. The application of the rope,
pulley, and weights, is obvious. The swivel at S permits the
frame to be swung round and lowered into water in the vessel
<em>a</em>, to wash off the acid, which, after immersion in the other
vessel, might continue to act on the sheets, encrusting them
with oxide. Between <em>p p</em> there is a wooden partition which
is not necessary, though it may be beneficial.</p>

<p>Fig. 3, represents an apparatus alluded to, <a href="#Page_419">page 419</a>. It
consists of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couronne des tasses</span>, reduced to a form no less
compact than that of the trough. Hollow parallelopipeds of
glass are substituted for tumblers or cells. The plates are
suspended to bars counterpoised like window-sashes.</p>

<p>The advantages are as follows. The material is one of the
best non-conductors, is easily cleansed, and is the most impervious
to solvents. The fracture of one of the cups is easily
remedied by a supernumerary. They may be procured (as
in the United States) where porcelain cannot be had. The
shock from 300 pairs is such as few will take a second time.
Some of the effects have already been stated.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>At Fig. 4, one of the hollow glass parallelopipeds on an
enlarged scale is represented.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>n the circle ABCD let AB
and BC denote any two arcs
contiguous to each other. Draw
their limiting diameters A<i>a</i>,
C<i>c</i>; their sines B<i>x</i>, B<i>y</i>; and
join <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>. Then will <i>xy</i> = sine
of <span class="nowrap">(AB + BC):</span> for if upon OB
as a diameter we describe a
circle, it will manifestly pass
through the points <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,
(since the angles O<i>x</i>B, O<i>y</i>B
are right, see Euc. 31. 3.) therefore O<i>x</i>B<i>y</i> is a quadrilateral
inscribed in a circle described on OB as a diameter, and the
angle <i>y</i>O<i>x</i> at the circumference stands upon an arc whose
chord is <i>xy</i>. Again, if from <i>a</i> we draw <i>ad</i> perpendicular to
C<i>c</i>, it will be the sine of the arc <i>ac</i> <span class="nowrap">(= AB + BC).</span> If now
we describe a circle on <i>a</i>O as diameter, it will pass through <i>d</i>,
(see Euc. 31. 3.) therefore <i>ad</i> is the chord of an arc on which
the angle <i>a</i>O<i>c</i> stands in the circle described on <i>a</i>O. But in
equal circles the chords of arcs on which equal angles at the
centres or circumferences stand are equal; (see Euc. 26. and
29. 3.) hence <i>xy</i> = <i>ad</i> = <span class="nowrap">sin(AB + BC).</span> Now sine O<i>x</i>B<i>y</i> is
a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle described on OB as diameter,
we shall have (Euc. D. 6.) <span class="nowrap">OB · <i>xy</i></span> = <span class="nowrap">B<i>x</i> · O<i>y</i> + B<i>y</i> · O<i>x</i></span> =
<span class="nowrap">sinAB · cosCB + sinCB · cosAB.</span> If OB be denoted by <i>r</i>, we

<p class="noindent">If AB = A, BC = B, and the radius <i>r</i> = 1, <span class="nowrap">sin(A + B)</span> = <span class="nowrap">sinA · CosB
+ sinB · cosA;</span> which is the known formula for the
sine of the sum of two arcs, to the radius 1.</p>

<p>Again, if through O we draw the diameter DE perpendicular
to A<i>a</i>, then will DC be the complement of <span class="nowrap">(AB + BC).</span> Draw
C<i>p</i>, the sine of DC = <span class="nowrap">cos(AB + BC).</span> Through B draw the
diameter B<i>b</i>; from <i>b</i>, draw the sines <i>bz</i>, <i>br</i>, of the arcs <i>bc</i>,
<i>b</i>E respectively, and join <i>z</i>, <i>r</i>. Then by describing two circles,
one on <i>b</i>O as diameter, the other on OC, it may be proved
as before that the circle described on <i>b</i>O passes through the
points <i>z</i> and <i>r</i>, and that the circle described on CO passes
through <i>p</i>: and hence, by the same reasoning as before, <i>zr</i> =
C<i>p</i> = <span class="nowrap">cos(AB + BC).</span> Now O<i>bzr</i> being a quadrilateral inscribed
in the circle described on <i>b</i>O, we have (by the prop.
before cited) <span class="nowrap"><i>b</i>O · <i>zr</i> + O<i>r</i> · <i>bz</i></span> = <span class="nowrap"><i>br</i> · O<i>z</i>;</span> and hence <span class="nowrap"><i>b</i>O · <i>zr</i></span> =
<span class="nowrap"><i>br</i> · O<i>z</i> &ndash; O<i>r</i> · <i>bz</i>.</span> But <i>br</i> = sine arc <i>b</i>E = sine arc BD; and
since BD is the complement of AB, <i>br</i> = cosAB. In like
manner O<i>z</i> = cosBC, O<i>r</i> = sinAB, and <i>bz</i> = sinBC; hence
by substitution, <span class="nowrap"><i>b</i>O · <i>zr</i></span> = <span class="nowrap">cosAB · cosBC &ndash; sinAB · sinBC.</span> By
using the same notation as before, we have <span class="nowrap">cos(A + B)</span> =

</span>
</span>

= (if <i>r</i> = 1) <span class="nowrap">cosA · cosB &ndash; sinA · sinB,</span>

which is the known formula for the cosine of the sum of
two arcs.</p>

<p>The same construction will answer for the two remaining
cases: for if we suppose that <i>b</i>E and <i>bc</i> are two arcs, then will
<i>c</i>E be their difference, and <i>zr</i> the sine of <i>c</i>E, as proved above;
hence <i>zr</i> <span class="nowrap">(= sin(<i>b</i>E &ndash; <i>bc</i>))</span> =

<span class="blkxxx">

  <span class="blka"><i>b</i>O</span>
</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>

But <i>br</i> = sin<i>b</i>E,
and O<i>r</i> = its cosine; and <i>bz</i> = sine <i>bc</i>, and O<i>z</i> = its cos.,
hence if <i>b</i>E be denoted by <i>a</i>, <i>bc</i> by <i>b</i>, and O<i>b</i> as before, then
will <span class="nowrap">sin(<i>a</i> &ndash; <i>b</i>)</span> =

<span class="nowrap">sin<i>a</i> · cos<i>b</i> &ndash; sin<i>b</i> · cos<i>a</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

Again, AB + BC is the complement of DC
or <i>c</i>E; hence by the first part of the above investigation,
<i>xy</i> = <span class="nowrap">sin(AB + BC)</span> = cos<i>c</i>E: but <i>xy</i> or <span class="nowrap">sin(A + B)</span> = <span class="nowrap">cos(<i>a</i> &ndash; <i>b</i>)</span>

  <span class="blka u">sinA · cosB + sinB · cosA</span>
  <span class="blka"><i>r</i></span>
</span>&nbsp;;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>

and as sinA or AB
= cosBD = cos<i>b</i>E, O<i>x</i> = cosA or AB = sinBD = sin<i>b</i>E, B<i>y</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
= <i>bz</i> = sin<i>bc</i>, and O<i>y</i> = O<i>z</i> = cos<i>bc</i>, we shall have, by substitution,

<span class="nowrap">cos(<i>a</i> &ndash; <i>b</i>)</span>

= <span class="nowrap">
<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka u">cos<i>a</i> · cos<i>b</i> + sin<i>a</i> · sin<i>b</i></span>

</span>

= <span class="nowrap">(if <i>r</i> = 1)</span>

<span class="nowrap">cos<i>a</i> · cos<i>b</i> + sin<i>a</i> · sin<i>b</i> .</span></p>

<p>From what has been said it appears, that if A and B be any
two arcs, of which A is the greatest, then</p>

<p class="center">
Sin(A ± B) =
<span class="nowrap">
<span class="blkxxx">
  <span class="blka u">sinA · cosB ± sinB · cosA</span>

Cos(A ± B) =

  <span class="blka u">cosA · cosB ∓ sinA · sinB</span>
  <span class="blka"><i>r</i></span>
</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>
</p>

<p>When the radius <i>r</i> is supposed = 1, the denominators in
these formulæ disappear. In the latter, A and B are used for
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, for the sake of homogeneity. The propriety of this
is manifest; for as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> denote two indefinite arcs, the same
reasoning will apply to A and B, as to <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, the first being
supposed in each case the greatest.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Mounds.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">O</span>n the plantation of Mr. John Kain of Knox county, near
the north bank of the Holston River, 5 miles above its junction
with the French Broad, is a curious collection of mounds
of earth, evidently the work of art, but of an almost antediluvian
antiquity, if we may form any conjecture of their age,
from that of the forest which grows around and upon them.
They are about half a dozen in number, and arise on about
half an acre of level ground without any seeming regularity.
They are pyramidal in their shape, or rather sections of pyramids,
whose bases are from 10 to 30 paces in diameter. The
largest one in this group rises about 10 feet above the level
ground, and is remarkably regular in its figure. A perpendicular
section of this mound was made about a year since, but
no important discovery was made. It was found to consist of
the surface thrown up, and contained a good deal of ashes and
charcoal.</p>

<p>This group of mounds is surrounded by a ditch, which can
be distinctly traced on three sides, and enclosing besides the
mounds, several acres of ground. It is like the mounds covered
with trees, which grow in it and about it. At every
angle of this ditch, it sweeps out into a semicircle, and it appears
in many respects well calculated for defence.</p>

<p>There are many other mounds of the same form in Tennessee.
At the junction of the French Broad with the Holston,
there is one in which human bones are said to have been found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Farther up French Broad, near Newport, is a very large mound.
It reposes on a very level and extensive plain, and is itself the
largest I ever saw. It is thirty feet high, and its base covers
half an acre of ground. As it ascends from its base, there is
a slight inclination from a perpendicular on all sides, and the
upper surface is as level as the rest is regular. From the great
size of this mound, its commanding situation, and the mystery
which veils its history, it is a most interesting spot of ground.
There are many other mounds of this description in the State
of Tennessee, but I have not visited them.</p>

<p>Though not immediately connected with this subject, I take
the liberty to subjoin an account of a remarkable cave or grotto,
in a bluff of limestone, on the south bank of the Holston River,
opposite the mounds first described. The bluff is perhaps 100
feet high and 50 wide. The grotto is a large natural excavation
of the rock, 60 feet high and 30 feet wide. It is very
irregular, and to the very top bears marks of the attrition of
waves. The river to have been so high, must have covered
the valley through which it now winds its quiet way. The
excavation gradually diminishes in size as you proceed backward,
till at 100 feet from the entrance, it terminates. A remarkable
projection of the rock divides the back part into two
stories. This grotto, whose walls are hung with ivy, and the
bluff crowned with cedars, and surrounded by an aged forest,
on which the vine clambers most luxuriantly, viewed from the
river which winds slowly around it, and reflects its image, is
more than beautiful: it is even venerable. But what renders
it most interesting to many visitors, is a number of rude paintings,
which were, as tradition reports, left on it by the Cherokee
Indians. These Indians are known to have made this
cave a resting-place, as they passed up and down the River
Holston. These paintings are still distinct, though they have
faded somewhat within my remembrance. They consist of
representations of the sun and moon, of a man, of birds,
fishes, &amp;c. They are all of red paint, and resemble in this
respect, the paintings on Paint Rock near the warm springs.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the objects of curiosity in the country
north of us; and I took the liberty to describe some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
in my preceding communication. Indeed we may say, without
danger of exaggeration, that the range of Alleghany Mountains
presents a variety of the most curious features, and many objects
of beauty and sublimity. I have noticed a few of the
most prominent, but "the half is not told."</p>

<p class="center"><em>Extract of a Letter, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p class="p1 right"><em>Knoxville, Nov. 24, 1818.</em></p>

<p>I was on a visit to a friend a few days since, about 30 miles
to the north of this, and was invited by him to visit an interesting
curiosity in the neighbourhood. We crossed the Clynch
River where it is much confined by mountains, and banks as
high as mountains. Our guide conducted us to the foot of a
steep declivity, where we left our horses, and with some difficulty
ascended about 70 yards. Here we came to the mouth
of a cave which had been stopped up by a stone wall. The
wall was made of limestone and mortar, which is now harder
than the stone itself. It is, without a doubt, artificial, for besides
the evidence afforded by its structure, it contains bones
and animal remains.</p>

<p>What was this wall built for? There was a tradition among
the inhabitants that it contained money, and they were much
disappointed on opening it, not to find any. Like other caves,
it contains a variety of calcareous concretions, and I obtained
some fine specimens of brown spar, which I will take the first
opportunity to send you.</p>

of the Human Mind in a Diseased State.</em></p>


<p class="noindent">1. <span class="fs200">S</span>ome years ago a farmer of fair character, who resided
in an interior town in New England, sold his farm, with an intention
of purchasing another in a different town. His mind
was naturally of a melancholy cast. Shortly after the sale of
his farm, he was induced to believe that he had sold it for less
than its value. This persuasion brought on dissatisfaction, and
eventually a considerable degree of melancholy. In this situation,
one of his neighbours engaged him to enclose a lot of
land, with a post and rail fence, which he was to commence
making the next day. At the time appointed he went into the
field, and began with a beetle and wedges to split the timber,
out of which the posts and rails were to be prepared. On
finishing his day's work, he put his beetle and wedges into a
hollow tree, and went home. Two of his sons had been at
work through the day in a distant part of the same field. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
his return, he directed them to get up early the next morning,
to assist him in making the fence. In the course of the evening
he became delirious, and continued in this situation several
years; when his mental powers were suddenly restored. The
first question which he asked after the return of his reason,
was, whether his sons had brought in the beetle and wedges.
He appeared to be wholly unconscious of the time that had
elapsed from the commencement of his delirium. His sons,
apprehensive that any explanations might induce a return of
his disease, simply replied that they had been unable to find
them. He immediately arose from his bed, went into the field
where he had been at work a number of years before, and
found the wedges, and the rings of the beetle, where he had
left them, the beetle itself having mouldered away. During
his delirium, his mind had not been occupied with those subjects
with which it was conversant in health.</p>

<p>2. Mrs. S., an intelligent lady, belonging to a respectable
family in the State of New-York, some years ago undertook a
piece of fine needlework. She devoted her time to it almost
constantly for a number of days. Before she had completed
it, she became suddenly delirious. In this state, without experiencing
any material abatement of her disease, she continued
for about seven years; when her reason was suddenly restored.
One of the first questions which she asked after her
reason returned, related to her needlework. It is a remarkable
fact, that during the long continuance of her delirium she
said nothing, so far as was recollected, about her needlework,
nor concerning any such subjects as usually occupied her attention
when in health.</p>

<p>3. A lady in New England, of a respectable family, was for
a considerable period subject to paroxysms of delirium. These
paroxysms came on instantaneously, and after continuing an indefinite
time, went off as suddenly; leaving her mind perfectly
rational. It often happened that when she was engaged in rational
and interesting conversation, she would stop short in the
midst of it, become in a moment entirely delirious, and commence
a conversation on some other subject, not having the
remotest connexion with the previous one, nor would she ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>vert
to that during her delirium. When she became rational
again, she would pursue the same conversation in which she
had been engaged during the lucid interval, beginning where
she had left off. To such a degree was this carried, that she
would complete an unfinished story or sentence, or even an
unfinished word. When her next delirious paroxysm came on,
she would continue the conversation which she had been pursuing
in her preceding paroxysm; so that she appeared as a
person might be supposed to do, who had two souls, each occasionally
dormant, and occasionally active, and utterly ignorant
of what the other was doing.</p>

<p><span class="pad1 smcap">Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="fs200">I</span>n answer to your inquiry concerning the discovery of sulphuret
of mercury and native lead in this country, I send you
the following summary of a letter I received from B. F. Stickney,
Esq. Indian agent, dated Fort Wayne, Dec. 1, 1818.</p>

<p>Mr. Stickney states, that the situation of Fort Wayne, and
the country surrounding, is a high level, probably about 800
feet above the sea. From this place the water-courses divide
and take different directions, on the one hand falling into the
Gulf of Mexico, and on the other into the Bay of St. Lawrence.
The whole country is of secondary formation, chiefly calcareous
and aluminous.</p>

<p>Bitumen and sulphur are every where to be found, and as
usual, accompanied by the metals.</p>

<p>In speaking of the cinnabar, his words are, "I have found
a black and garnet-coloured sand, in great abundance on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
shores of the Lakes Erie and Michigan, this is a sulphuret of
mercury, and yields about sixty per cent. It is so easy to be
obtained, and in so convenient a form for distillation, that it
must become an important article of commerce."</p>

<p>The native lead was found on the Anglaize River, at a considerable
distance from the fort.</p>

<p>Of this he says, "metallic lead is so interspersed with galena,
as to prove incontestably the existence of native lead."</p>

<p class="p2 center">2. <em>Theoretical views of Professor Hare of Philadelphia.</em></p>

<p>We are authorized to mention, that Dr. Robert Hare has
taught in his lectures during the last eighteen months, that acid
properties never appearing in the absence of water, this fluid
or its elements are most entitled to be considered as the acidifying
principle: but that probably it does not exist in acids as
water, but is decomposed when added to them, the particles
of hydrogen and oxygen by their different polarities taking
opposite sides of those composing the base. The extrication
of hydrogen by the action of diluted sulphuric acid on iron or
zinc, being the consequence of a previous, not simultaneous
decomposition of water. Hence when sulphuric or nitric
acids are so concentrated as to char or ignite, they are not
acids really.</p>

<p>Robert Brown of London, is endeavouring to group the natural
orders of plants into natural classes, or rather into larger
natural orders, with determinate characters: he has communicated
some parts of his labour to the botanists of Paris. He
has been the first to employ as a new character in the distinction
of natural orders, the estivation of flowers, or the manner
in which they are folded in the buds.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierce and myself lately found staurotide on the
island of New-York. It occurs in considerable quantity in a
rock of <em>mica slate</em>, on the banks of the Hudson, about three
and a half miles from the city. The crystals very seldom form
the perfect cross, though many were found, intersecting each
other imperfectly at angles of 60°. Several single crystals
were obtained exceedingly perfect. They were short 4-sided
prisms, with the acute lateral edges truncated at each ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>tremity
on the two solid angles of the most obtuse lateral
edges, forming diedral terminations at each extremity
of the prism. The faces of these terminations
were inclined to each other at an angle
of 67° and a few minutes. The annexed figure
shows the form of the crystal."</p>

A. M.</p></div>

<p class="p1" />
<p>The following minerals, found in the region above named,
were either omitted in the former list, or have been noticed
since that was made out.</p>

<p><em>Bog-iron Ore.</em> In Greenfield and Warwick.</p>

<p class="p2 pfs70">THE LEVERETT RANGE OF GRANITE.</p>

<p>This name is given to a granite range that emerges from
the puddingstone near the centre of Amherst, and extends
northerly, with some interruption, nearly thirty miles, through
Leverett and Montague to Northfield. And, indeed, there is
some reason to suppose that it again appears to the north of
Northfield. The range is widest in Leverett, where its
breadth is more than a mile. It is noticed in the "Remarks,"
No. 2, Art. I, of this Journal, and may be seen on the section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
accompanying that communication. But on further examination
it has been found to be more extensive than was supposed.
The texture of the rock is coarse. Plates of mica,
3 or 4 inches across, are common in it; and one specimen of
a beautiful blue feldspar, the fragment only of a crystal, measured
in one direction 8 inches.</p>

<p>Two circumstances in this range give it an interest in the
eye of a geologist. The one is its proximity to sandstone and
puddingstone; and the other, its small elevation in comparison
with the surrounding rocks of later formations. In some
places no other rock could be found lying between the granite
and puddingstone; though the soil prevented my observing
whether there is an actual contact. But in general there is a
stratum of mica slate a few rods wide between these rocks,
and not unfrequently gneiss lies between the mica slate and
granite.</p>

<p>Standing on this range in Leverett, you have on the west,
at about 100 rods distant, a precipitous mountain of sandstone
and puddingstone, five or six hundred feet higher than the
granite. On the east, a mile or two distant, a mountain of
sienite gradually rises to a still greater height than the puddingstone;
and on the southwest, at nearly the same distance,
you can see an alluvial formation. In general this granite
does not rise so high as the adjacent rocks, whether secondary
or primitive.</p>


<p class="p2 pfs70">VEINS OF ORE IN THIS GRANITE.</p>

<p class="center">1. <em>Of Galena in Leverett.</em></p>

<p>This ore forms a narrow vein in the southwest part of the
town, on land of Moses Smith, two miles from the Congregational
meeting-house. The direction of the vein is nearly
north and south, and where I saw it, only a foot wide. The
gangue is sulphate of barytes.</p>

<p class="center">2. <em>Of Galena, Copper Pyrites, and Blende.</em></p>

<p>This vein is a little more than a mile north of the one
above described, and it may be a continuation of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
vein. The gangue is nearly an equal admixture of sulphate
of barytes and quartz; and galena and sulphuret of copper
are disseminated through it in about the same, that is, equal
proportions. The blende, which is of a yellowish aspect
when the fractured crystal is held in a certain position, appears
only occasionally. This vein is several feet wide, has
been wrought to a small extent in two places, and its direction
is nearly north and south. It is on land of Mr. Field.</p>

<p><em>Radiated quartz.</em> In the above vein. A considerable tendency
to crystallization appears at this place, not only in the
quartz, but in the foliated structure of the barytes.</p>

<p><em>Brown spar.</em> In the same place. But little of this mineral
was noticed. It exfoliated before the blowpipe, turned black,
and became magnetic.</p>


<p class="center">3. <em>Of Specular Oxide of Iron in Montague.</em></p>

<p>This is found in a partially detached eminence, 100 feet
high, near the north line of Montague, on land of Mr. Taft, a
little southwest from the confluence of Miller's river with the
Connecticut. The whole hill, not less than 100 rods in circumference
at its base, is traversed by numerous veins of this
ore; and scarcely a foot of the rock is to be seen that does
not contain these, varying in width from a mere line to several
inches. The principal vein appears on the top of the hill;
and is, as nearly as I could determine, not less than ten feet
wide, lying in a north and south direction. The ore seems
to be abundant, and generally pure. Masses, that have been
separated by blasting, and weighing from 100 to 200 pounds,
lie on the surface. A small proportion of sulphuret of iron
was observed in some specimens. The gangue is quartz, and
the walls and hill granite.</p>

<p>No opinion is here intended to be offered concerning the
probable value of these ores, if worked. If they be useless
to the present generation, they may not be so to some future
one, when labour shall be cheaper; and therefore it was
thought to be of some consequence to point out their localities.</p>

<p>In the remarks, to which this paper is a supplement, <em>blue
quartz</em> was inadvertently put down among the minerals found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
in Deerfield. I presume it does not exist there. It is also
probable that the variety of garnets found in Conway, is not,
as formerly stated, the melanite.</p>


<p class="p1 center">7. <em>New Process for Tanning.</em></p>

<p>A process for effecting the tanning of leather in a neat, expeditious,
and thorough manner, has been discovered by a
Mr. Steel, of Connecticut: some account of it may be given

<p class="p1 center">8. <em>Connexion between Chemistry and Medicine.</em></p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="fs200">I</span>n the prospectus of this work, the expectation was expressed
that each Number would contain from 64 to 80 pages; that as
many as four Numbers might be issued within the year, and
engravings were promised for such subjects as might require
them.</p>

<p>The Numbers published, have actually contained from 104
to 132 pages, the four have been issued within a period of ten
months, and twelve copper-plate engravings and several woodcuts,
illustrate the present volume.</p>

<p>Of the subjects proposed in the plan of the work, our pages
contain notices, more or less extensive, of Geology, Mineralogy,
Botany, Zoology, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mathematics,
Useful Arts, Fine Arts, Inventions, Reviews, Biography, and
Intelligence. How far then we have redeemed our pledge,
we leave it for our readers to decide.</p>

<p>In the commencement of an enterprise, for the first time
attempted in this country, an enterprise arduous in its nature
and uncertain in its issue, it will not be doubted that considerable
solicitude was experienced.</p>

<p>To concentrate American efforts in science and the arts, by
furnishing a Journal to record their proceedings, will, in our
view, not only have a direct influence in promoting the honour
and prosperity of the nation as connected with its physical interests,
but will also tend in no small degree to nourish an
enlarged patriotism, by winning the public mind from the odious
asperities of party. That entire success will attend our
efforts, it would perhaps be presumptuous to expect, but we
trust that the interesting previous question, whether such a
work can be adequately sustained, by appropriate materials,
may be considered as now decided. The support which we
have received, and for which we are deeply grateful, has been
far beyond our most sanguine hopes, and has caused us to dispense
with no small portion of those less important efforts of
our own, with which we were prepared to succour our infant
undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>If we may be allowed to express a wish relative to the nature
of future communications, it would be, that those of a scientific
nature should not be diminished, while those relating to the
arts, to agriculture, and to domestic economy, should be increased;
we particularly solicit the communications of practical
men, versed in the useful and ornamental arts, and they will
be acceptable should they not even be clothed in a scientific
dress.</p>

<p>Arrangements have been made for the reception of an increased
number of the best European Journals, both from the
continent and from Britain; they have already begun to arrive,
and we hope to give in future numbers, more full details of
foreign scientific intelligence, although it is true that this species
of information has hitherto been stinted, not from poverty
of materials, but from the pressure of original American communications.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In justice to the publishers of this work, we add, that <em>this
publication is an expensive one</em>; very heavy advances have been
already made by them, while only a trivial amount has been
received in return. It is hoped, therefore, that subscribers
will promptly remit, <em>free from postage</em>, the small stipulated
sum, and also make the required advance for the succeeding
volume. This last is not due till the first number of that volume
has been issued, but it would save postage to remit both sums
at once, and thus also it will be known what subscriptions are
continued. In a subscription so widely dispersed over a large
portion of the United States, an inattention to <em>punctual payment</em>,
must soon put in hazard the existence of a work, having otherwise
the fairest prospects of continuance, and we hope of usefulness.</p>

<p>Should this appeal be promptly answered, the first number
of the next volume (already in considerable forwardness,) will
be published in the course of the summer; and should men of
ability continue to furnish communications, and <em>the public be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
willing to pay for the work</em>, it is our wish to publish future numbers
with greater frequency, and to complete our volumes
whenever we are prepared, without confining ourselves to particular
periods of time.</p>

of gentlemen, residing in various parts of the United States.
An Act of Incorporation, conferring the necessary powers, has
been granted by the Legislature of Connecticut, and farther
accounts of the plan and progress of the Society may be expected
in future numbers of this work.</p>

excuse the notice to which his labours so justly entitle him. To him we are indebted
for a complete science of crystallography, and for having determined the
existence and limit of species, which mineralogists had not obtained, and chemists
could not determine. He has devoted a long life to the improvement of science,
and it is his praise, that he has preserved the meekness of religion amidst the
most flattering success. Our scientific countrymen, who have visited Paris, have
been particularly indebted to him; and this notice is, in their behalf, both the
tribute of justice and gratitude.</p></div>

some experiments, which he made at my request upon the last snow which fell.
"A pint and a half of snow water was reduced by evaporation to a few drops.
On testing this with vegetable blue infusions no alteration of colour took place.
It was afterward evaporated to dryness, and about a quarter of a grain of a solid residuum
was obtained. This was redissolved in a small quantity of pure rain water,
and prussiate of potash added to it, without occasioning any precipitate. Nitrate
of silver produced a white precipitate so copious, that the solution was thick with
it. Carbonate of soda produced no effect. The transparency of a solution of
muriate of barytes was not disturbed by it. These experiments prove, that a <em>free
acid</em> does not exist in snow water, but that the muriate exists in it combined with
an alkali, which is most probably soda."</p></div>

following facts, for which I am indebted to my friend, Dr. D. V. Knevels, are
conclusive. The fruit of those cocoa-nut trees which grow near the seashore in the
West-Indies is generally found to have a saltish taste; and even the milk in the
nut is perceptibly impregnated with it. Those trees on the contrary which grow in
the interior, beyond the influence of salt water, have their fruit perfectly fresh and
sweet.
</p>
<p>
The same gentleman informs me, that in a plantation of his father's, in the
West-Indies, situated on the seashore, a whole crop of the cane was rendered
unfit for the purpose of making sugar, in consequence of the great quantity of salt
which it had imbibed.</p></div>

appear in innumerable other situations, equally exposed to salt air, as Cape Cod,
and the West-India Islands?" To this it may be replied, that in the production
of any disease whatever, a <em>predisposing</em> state of the system is as necessary as an
<em>exciting</em> cause. This predisposition appears to exist in a great degree among the
Egyptians, and depends upon the nature of their climate, their habits, and mode of
living, all of which have a tendency to produce <em>debility</em> of the eyes, and thus render
them more susceptible of the impression of those causes which excite inflammation.</p></div>

that possibly chrome might exist in the ores, they had been intensely heated in a
forge along with pearl ashes. The mass, when lixiviated, gave only a greenish
solution, becoming colourless by nitric acid, and again greenish by an alkali; this
was supposed to be owing to iron and manganese. No metal was obtained, except
a few minute globules of attractable iron, but the laboratory was filled with white
fumes, having the peculiar odour alluded to.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
